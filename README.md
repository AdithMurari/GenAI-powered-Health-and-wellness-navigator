# Overview

This project introduces an advanced Ayurvedic health and wellness navigator empowered by Langchain framework, and the open-source large language model, Llama 3. The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline is designed to offer tailored solutions and optimize response customization for precise Ayurvedic health guidance.

Drawing insights from the esteemed Ayurvedic literature, particularly referencing "The Complete Book of Ayurvedic Home Remedies" by Vasant V. Lad, the project ensures authenticity and reliability in its recommendations. Data ingestion and conversion of text into embeddings are facilitated, with storage in a vector database, ChromaDB, to maintain the integrity of the provided solutions.

Upon user query generation, the system retrieves the context most closely resembling the query from the vector database and prompts the large language model accordingly. The response generated by the large language model is tailored to the provided context, ensuring both high accuracy and relevance to the user's query.
