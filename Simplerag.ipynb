       " Document(page_content='Introduction\\nThe Need for Healing\\nAyurveda is the art of daily living in harmony with the laws of nature. It is an\\nancient natural wisdom of health and healing, a science of life. The aims and objectives\\nof this science are to maintain the health of a healthy person and to heal the disease of\\nan unhealthy person. Both prevention (maintenance of good health) and healing are\\ncarried out by entirely natural means.\\nAccording to Ayurveda, health is a perfect state of balance among the body’s three\\nfundamental energies, or \\ndoshas (vata, pitta, kapha)\\n and an equally vital balance among\\nbody, mind, and the soul or consciousness.\\nAyurveda is a profound science of living that encompasses the whole of life and\\nrelates the life of the individual to the life of the universe. It is a holistic system of\\nhealing in the truest sense. Body, mind, and consciousness are in constant interaction\\nand relationship with other people and the environment. In working to create health,\\nAyurveda takes into consideration these diʃerent levels of life and their\\ninterconnectedness.\\nAs a science of self-healing, Ayurveda encompasses diet and nutrition, lifestyle,\\nexercise, rest and relaxation, meditation, breathing exercises, and medicinal herbs, along\\nwith cleansing and rejuvenation programs for healing body, mind, and spirit. Numerous\\nadjunct therapies such as sound, color, and aromatherapy may also be employed. The\\npurpose of this book is to acquaint you with these natural methods, so you can make the\\nlifestyle choices and learn the self-healing modalities that are right for you in order to\\ncreate, maintain, or restore health and balance.\\nAyurveda\\n is a Sanskrit word that means “the science of life and longevity.” According\\nto this science, every individual is both a creation of cosmic energies and a unique\\nphenomenon, a unique personality. Ayurveda teaches that we all have a constitution,\\nwhich is our individual psychobiological makeup. From the moment of conception, this\\nindividual constitution is created by the universal energies of Space, Air, Fire, Water,\\nand Earth.\\nThese ɹve elements combine into the three fundamental energies, or \\ndoshas\\n. Ether\\nand air constitute vata, which is the energy of movement; ɹre and water constitute\\npitta, the principle of digestion or metabolism, the transformation of matter into energy;\\nand water and earth make up kapha, the energy of structure and lubrication. When the\\nmale sperm and the female egg join at the time of fertilization, the vata–pitta–kapha\\nfactors from the parents’ bodies that are most active and predominant at the moment,\\ndue to the season, the time, the emotional state, and the quality of their relationship,\\nform a new individual with a particular constellation of qualities.', metadata={'source': 'Ayurveda.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='In modern terms we speak of this blueprint of the individual as our inherited genetic\\ncode; from ancient times Ayurveda has called it our \\nprakruti\\n or individual constitution, a\\nconstant factor that does not change throughout life. It is our own unique pattern of\\nenergy, our combination of physical, mental, and emotional characteristics and\\npredispositions.\\nThough the underlying structure of our \\nprakruti\\n remains a fixed reality, our home base\\nor essential individuality, it is constantly bombarded by numerous forces. Changes in\\nage and in our external environment, alternating heat and cold as the seasons pass, our\\nendlessly shifting thoughts, feelings, and emotions, and the quality and quantity of the\\nfood we eat continuously aʃect us. Unhealthy diet, excess stress, insuɽcient rest or\\nexercise, and repressed emotions all disturb our \\ndoshic\\n balance. Depending on the type\\nof changes and the individual’s underlying constitution, various ailments may develop:\\n• Some individuals experience an increase or aggravation of kapha, leading to\\nconditions such as colds, congestion, sneezing, and allergic manifestations, as well as\\nattachment, greed, and possessiveness.\\n• A pitta individual may become highly critical, angry, or perfectionistic, or may\\ndevelop physical symptoms such as acid indigestion, heartburn, diarrhea, dysentery,\\nhives, rash, or acne.\\n• Vata imbalances may manifest as constipation, abdominal distention, sciatica,\\narthritis, or insomnia, along with psychological symptoms such as fear, anxiety, and\\ninsecurity.\\nAll these illnesses and conditions, in addition to the countless others that lead to\\nhuman suʃering, are due to alterations in the body’s inner ecology. These upset the\\nindividual’s balance, creating subtle biochemical changes that ultimately lead to disease.\\nThis is why the Ayurvedic system of medicine speaks of the need for healing for every\\nindividual in every walk of life.\\nAs the internal and external conditions of our lives change, if we are going to remain\\nhealthy we need to constantly adjust in order to maintain equilibrium. Some of this\\nadjusting takes place automatically due to the beautiful wisdom and intelligence with\\nwhich our bodies have been designed. But much demands conscious choice.\\nTo maintain health and balance, we have \\nto juggle with the three doshas, taking\\naction to increase or decrease vata, pitta, or kapha as conditions demand. This requires\\nmoment-to-moment awareness, moment-to-moment consciousness, moment-to-moment\\nhealing.\\nThus healing—healthy, balanced, conscious living in the fullness of the present\\nmoment—is really a way of life. Ayurveda is not a passive form of therapy but rather\\nasks each individual to take responsibility for his or her own daily living. Through our\\ndiet, our relationships, our job, our numerous responsibilities, and our daily life as a\\nwhole, we can take simple actions for prevention, self-healing, wholeness, and growth', metadata={'source': 'Ayurveda.pdf', 'page': 10}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='toward fulfillment.\\nAccording to Ayurveda, our life has a purpose. Simply stated, that purpose is to know\\nor realize the Creator (Cosmic Consciousness) and to understand our relationship with\\nThat, which will entirely inɻuence our daily living. This great purpose is to be achieved\\nby balancing four fundamental aspects of life: \\ndharma\\n, which is duty or right action;\\nartha\\n, material success or wealth; \\nkama\\n, positive desire; and \\nmoksha\\n, spiritual liberation.\\nThese are called the four \\npurusharthas\\n, the four great aims or achievements in the life of\\nany individual.\\nThe foundation of all these facets of life is health. To maintain \\ndharma\\n and carry out\\nour duties and responsibilities to ourselves and others, we must be healthy. Likewise, in\\norder to create aʀuence and achieve success in action, good health is indispensable. To\\nhave creative, positive desire, we need a healthy mind and consciousness, a healthy\\nbody, and healthy perception. (Desire—\\nkama\\n—is sometimes translated as sex and refers\\nto progeny and family life, but it is really the positive energy or force of desire that\\ngenerates and propels any creative work.) And \\nmoksha\\n or spiritual liberation is nothing\\nbut perfect harmony of body, mind, and consciousness or soul. Thus the whole possibility\\nof achievement and fulfillment in life rests on good health.\\nIn the quarter century that I have been practicing medicine, I have worked in\\nsurgery, gynecology, obstetrics, and pediatrics, as well as in general medicine, treating\\nthousands of individuals in all stages and walks of life. I have repeatedly observed that\\nlifestyle choices, such as diet, exercise, and daily routine, can be a potent source of\\nhealing as well as a cause of disease. Many health problems seem intertwined with the\\nstresses of daily life, family and relationship problems, and worries about job and\\nmoney. Others are directly connected to eating the wrong kinds of food or getting too\\nmuch or too little exercise.\\nI have also grown more and more aware that illness provides us with an invitation\\nfor self-transformation, an opportunity to change our way of thinking, feeling, eating,\\nand in general caring for ourselves and our lives. It never ceases to amaze and delight\\nme how quickly and powerfully life can be set on the right track and balance restored\\nsimply through a proper diet, herbal medicines, meditation, an appropriate exercise\\nprogram, and other purely natural means.\\nThe remedies in this book come from my own practical clinical experience, based on\\nprinciples and practices developed over centuries. The tradition of Ayurveda extends\\nback over more than ɹve thousand years of continuous daily practice, from ancient\\ntimes to the present day. It is not a recently developed system of “alternative healing”\\nbut an enduring science of life that has never lost its integrity and essential nature. You\\ncan imagine how much wisdom it contains and how much practical knowledge it has\\naccumulated over a span of five millennia!\\nAbout three thousand years ago (around 900 \\nB.C\\n.), the long oral tradition of Ayurveda\\ntook new form when three great scholars—Charaka, Sushruta, and Vagbhata—wrote', metadata={'source': 'Ayurveda.pdf', 'page': 11}),\n",

Both \\nPurusha\\n and \\nPrakruti\\n are eternal, timeless, and\\nimmeasurable. These two energies are present in all living organisms, including every\\nman and woman, as well as inanimate objects.\\nPurusha\\n is formless and beyond attributes.

Creation of this universe happens through their love. All of nature\\nis the child born from the womb of \\nPrakruti\\n, the Divine Mother.\\nIn the manifestation of nature from \\nPrakruti\\n, the ɹrst expression is \\nMahad\\n (or \\nMahat\\n),\\nintelligence or cosmic order. (In human beings, it is referred to as \\nBuddhi\\n, intellect.) Next\\nis \\nAhamkar\\n or ego, the sense of self-identity, the center in our consciousness from which\\nwe think, act, and react. \\nAhamkar\\n expresses itself in three universal qualities:\\nSattva\\n is stability, purity, wakefulness, essence, clarity, and light.\\nRajas\\n is dynamic movement and causes sensations, feelings, and emotions.', metadata={'source': 'Ayurveda.pdf', 'page': 14}),\n",

Whatever is present in the cosmos, the same is present\\nin human beings. Man is a miniature of nature.\\nThe Five Elements: Building Blocks of Nature\\nThe concept of the ɹve elements is one of the most fundamental in Ayurvedic\\nscience. These ɹve elements (space, air, ɹre, water, and earth) exist in all matter, both\\norganic and inorganic. As man is a microcosm of nature, the ɹve elements also exist\\nwithin each individual. Our psychological tendencies, as well as our ɹve senses and the\\nvarious aspects of our body’s functioning, are all directly related to the five elements.\\nAccording to Ayurveda, the ɹve elements manifest sequentially, beginning with\\nspace, from the pure, uniɹed, unmanifested Cosmic Consciousness that is the source of\\nall.\\nSPACE\\nSometimes referred to as “ether,” space is empty, light, subtle, all-pervading,\\nomnipresent, and all-enclosing. It is universal, non-moving, and formless. Space is\\nnuclear energy. It appears when the pure unmanifest consciousness begins to vibrate\\nand is associated with sound and the sense of hearing. We need space in order to live,\\nmove, grow, and communicate. Spaces in the body include the mouth, nose,\\ngastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, abdomen, and thorax. Psychologically, space\\ngives freedom, peace, and expansion of consciousness and is responsible for love and\\ncompassion as well as feelings of separation, isolation, emptiness, ungroundedness,\\ninsecurity, anxiety, and fear.', metadata={'source': 'Ayurveda.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",

The principle of\\nmovement, air expresses itself in the movements of the muscles, the pulsations of the\\nheart, the expansion and contraction of the lungs.

Fire is radiant energy. On the atomic\\nlevel, the atom radiates heat and light in the form of a quantum wave. Fire is active and\\nchangeable. In our solar system, the sun is the source of ɹre and light. In the body, our\\nbiological “ɹre” in the solar plexus regulates body temperature and metabolism:\\ndigestion, absorption, and assimilation. Fire is associated with light and with vision. Fire\\nis intelligence. It is necessary for transformation, attention, comprehension,\\nappreciation, recognition, and understanding. Fire is also responsible for anger, hatred,\\nenvy, criticism, ambition, and competitiveness.\\nWATER\\nThe next manifestation of consciousness, water is ɻuid, heavy, soft, viscous, cold,\\ndense, and cohesive. It brings molecules together. Water is chemical energy (it is the\\nuniversal chemical solvent). Water is associated with the sense of taste; without moisture\\nthe tongue cannot taste anything. Water exists in the body as plasma, cytoplasm, serum,\\nsaliva, nasal secretion, cerebrospinal ɻuid, urine, and sweat. It is necessary for nutrition\\nand to maintain life; without it, our cells could not survive. Water is contentment, love,\\nand compassion.

For health, and often for sheer survival, we have to continuously\\naccommodate ourselves to these changes, through what we eat, what we wear, where we\\nlive, and so on. This is a balancing act, playing elements against each other. We use\\nsolid earth to build homes, to protect ourselves against changes in air, heat (ɹre), and\\nwater. We use fire to prepare food (made of water and earth).\\nThe Three Doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha\\nThese ɹve great elements combine into three basic energies or functional principles,\\nwhich are present, in varying degrees, in everything and everybody. Space (ether) and\\nair constitute vata. Fire and water combine to make up pitta. Water and earth constitute\\nkapha.\\nIn our bodies, these three doshas or humors govern our psychobiological functioning.\\nvata–pitta–kapha are present in every cell, tissue, and organ. When in balance, they\\ncreate health. When out of balance, they are the cause of disease.\\nThese three doshas are responsible for the huge variety of individual diʃerences and\\npreferences, and they inɻuence all we are and all we do, from our choices of food to our\\nmodes of relating to others. They govern the biological and psychological processes of\\nour body, mind, and consciousness. They regulate the creation, maintenance, and\\ndestruction of bodily tissue, and the elimination of waste products. They also govern our\\nemotions. When in balance, they generate noble qualities such as understanding,\\ncompassion, and love. When their balance is disturbed by stress, improper diet,\\nenvironmental conditions or other factors, they can give rise to negative emotions such\\nas anger, fear, and greed.\\nIn Ayurveda, vata is the bodily air principle. It is the energy of movement. Pitta is\\nthe principle of ɹre, the energy of digestion and metabolism. And kapha is the principle\\nof water, the energy of lubrication and structure.\\nAll people have all of these three doshas, but one of them is usually primary, one\\nsecondary, and the third least prominent. Thus, each person has a particular pattern of\\nenergy, an individual combination of physical, mental, and emotional characteristics\\nthat make up his or her constitution (\\nprakruti\\n).

But since order is inherent within disorder, the wise person\\nlearns to be aware of the presence of disorder and sets about to reestablish order.\\nIn \\nchapter 2\\n we will see how the three fundamental doshas combine to create the\\nseven constitutional types of Ayurveda, and you will learn your own body type, the key\\nto making lifestyle choices for self-healing and maximum well-being. For the moment,\\nlet us look a little more deeply into the characteristics of these three basic energies of\\nlife.\\nVATA\\nVata is the energy of movement. Although it is the air \\nprinciple\\n, it is not considered\\nthe same as actual air in the external environment, but rather as the subtle energy that\\ngoverns biological movement.\\nVata is intimately related to our vital life essence, known as \\nprana. Prana\\n is the pure\\nessence of vata. It is the life-force, the play of intelligence. That ɻow of intelligence is\\nnecessary for communication between two cells, and it maintains the life function of\\nboth. On a cosmic level, \\nprana\\n is said to be the attraction between \\nPurusha\\n and \\nPrakruti\\n.\\nAs the principle of mobility, vata regulates all activity in the body, both mental and\\nphysiological. It is responsible for breathing, the blinking of our eyes, the beating of our\\nhearts, and all movement in the cytoplasm and cell membranes. All the impulses in the\\nvast networks of our nervous system are governed by vata.\\nWhen vata is in balance, it promotes creativity and ɻexibility and evokes feelings of\\nfreshness, lightness, happiness, and joy. Out of balance, vata produces fear,\\nnervousness, anxiety, even tremors and spasms.\\nVata is dry, light, cold, subtle, clear, mobile, and dispersing. We shall soon see how\\nthese qualities are expressed in a person with a vata constitution.\\nPITTA\\nPitta is translated as ɹre, but this is not meant literally. Rather, it is the \\nprinciple\\n of\\nɹre, the energy of heating or metabolism. Pitta governs all the biochemical changes that\\ntake place within our bodies, regulating digestion, absorption, assimilation, and body\\ntemperature.

It is the energy that forms the body’s structure, the\\nglue that holds the cells together. Kapha also supplies the liquid needed for the life of\\nour cells and bodily systems. It lubricates our joints, moisturizes the skin, helps to heal\\nwounds, and maintains immunity. Kapha provides strength, vigor, and stability.\\nPsychologically, excess kapha is responsible for the emotions of attachment, greed,\\nlust, and envy. When kapha is in balance it expresses itself in tendencies toward love,\\ncalmness, and forgiveness.\\nThe qualities of kapha include heavy, slow, cool, oily, damp, smooth, soft, static,\\nviscous, and sweet. Kapha individuals display these qualities in various ways.\\nTogether, these three doshas govern all the body’s metabolic activities. Kapha\\npromotes anabolism, the process of building up the body, the growth and creation of\\nnew cells as well as cell repair. Pitta regulates metabolism, which is digestion and\\nabsorption. Vata triggers catabolism, the necessary deterioration process in which larger\\nmolecules are broken down into smaller ones.\\nVata, the principle of movement, moves both pitta and kapha, which are immobile.\\nThus when vata is out of balance, it inɻuences and disturbs the other doshas. The\\nmajority of illnesses have aggravated vata at their source.\\nThe whole of life’s journey is divided into three major milestones. From birth to age\\n16 is the kapha age. From 16 to 50 is the age of pitta, and from 50 to 100 the age of\\nvata.\\nIn childhood, kapha and the process of anabolism are predominant, as this is the\\ntime of greatest physical growth and the structuring of the body. Kapha disorders, such\\nas lung congestion, cough, colds, and mucus secretions, are common at this time. In\\nadulthood, a time of activity and vitality, pitta is most apparent. Vata and the catabolic\\nprocesses of deterioration take over in old age, bringing vata disorders such as tremors,\\nemaciation, breathlessness, arthritis, and loss of memory.\\nThe Twenty Qualities: An Important Key to Healing', metadata={'source': 'Ayurveda.pdf', 'page': 20}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Now we come to another important aspect of Ayurvedic theory, which will help you\\nto make intelligent choices for self-healing. Ayurveda delineates twenty fundamental\\nqualities, which appear in ten pairs:\\nThe Twenty Basic Attributes or Qualities\\nHeavy—Light\\nOily—Dry\\nStable—Mobile\\nSlimy—Rough\\nGross—Subtle\\nCold—Hot\\nSlow—Sharp\\nSoft—Hard\\nDense—Liquid\\nCloudy—Clear\\nThese qualities are found both in the world around us and in our bodies. Today’s\\nweather may feel light or heavy, and it may be liquid or dry, mobile (windy) or stable,\\nhot or cold, cloudy or clear. Food we eat can partake of any of these qualities. Ice\\ncream, for example, is heavy, oily, cold, soft, and liquid. Our skin may be oily or dry,\\nrough or smooth. Our moods, too, can be heavy or light, cloudy or clear; our thinking\\nmay be slow or sharp, our mind quiet and stable or mobile and hyperactive, clear or\\ncloudy.\\nWe are constantly aʃected by changes in these qualities. Cold, windy, clear, dry\\nweather aggravates vata dosha and may lead to colds and any number of vata ailments\\nsuch as insomnia, constipation, or arthritis. Hot, humid weather aggravates pitta and\\nmay lead to outbreaks of irritation and anger as well as physical complaints like acne,\\neczema, or skin rashes. Cloudy, gray, humid or rainy weather can aggravate kapha,\\nleading to colds and coughs, depression, lethargy, overeating and oversleeping, and\\nweight gain.\\nEach of these paired qualities represents the extreme on a continuum. The two\\nqualities in each pair inɻuence or aʃect one another according to two fundamental\\nprinciples of Ayurveda:\\n1. Like increases like.\\n2. Opposites decrease each other.\\nThese principles are a key to healing with Ayurveda. When an imbalance has\\nmanifested, \\nsuccessful treatment requires increasing opposite qualities\\n.

Similarly, if you are cold and shivering from exposure to cold windy weather,\\nhave a bowl of warm soup, wrap up in a blanket, or take a hot bath. These simple\\nremedies immediately make sense when we hear them because they are so natural.\\nAyurvedic physicians have carefully observed nature and located these qualities\\nwithin all things, both organic and inorganic. Ayurvedic treatment consists to a great\\nextent of identifying a person’s disorder in terms of these qualities, and setting right any\\nimbalances.\\nHow is this done? Speaking in very general terms, excessive dryness in the body—\\nconstipation, dry skin, emaciation, and so on—is frequently associated with aggravated\\nvata; excessive heat—burning urine, irritated eyes, fever, inɻammation, anger, or a\\ncritical attitude—with aggravated pitta; and undue heaviness—lethargy, overweight,\\ncongestion, and excess mucus—with unbalanced kapha. Whatever the symptoms may\\nbe, for self-treatment you need to understand them and then adjust your lifestyle—diet,\\nexercise, and so on—to restore a state of balance and health.\\nThe hundreds of remedies in \\nPart III\\n of this book will help you to do this, but\\nessentially it is your own moment-to-moment awareness and self-observation, your\\nsensitivity to your own constitution and your own unique requirements for health, and\\nperhaps most importantly, your willingness to act on your knowledge, that will make all\\nthe difference between poor health and a vital, happy, healthy, long life.', metadata={'source': 'Ayurveda.pdf', 'page': 22}),\n",

Thus, ten vata individuals, or ten kapha-pitta individuals,\\nwill have ten diʃerent temperaments, ten unique sets of qualities and characteristics.\\nMaintaining our individual qualitative and quantitative proportion of the doshas is our\\nchallenge if we are to remain healthy. When we maintain this proportion our health is\\ngood, but when the balance is upset, disease may result.\\nPrakruti and Vikruti\\nAt the time of conception, each person’s combination and proportion of vata, pitta,\\nand kapha is determined according to the genetics, diet, lifestyle, and current emotions\\nof the parents. As mentioned in the Introduction, the doshas predominant in the parents\\ncombine to form the constitution of the new life they are creating.\\nIf, for example, the father is pitta predominant and the mother vata predominant,\\nand the pitta factor is stronger than the vata, and the union is taking place on a hot\\nsummer \\nnight after eating a spicy meal, then the baby that is born will have a\\nconstitution that is pitta predominant. Or if both parents are kapha, and they have a\\nkaphagenic diet and are making love in kapha season, then their child will have a\\npredominance of kapha dosha.\\nA few fortunate individuals are born with a constitution in which all three doshas are\\nequally present, which gives them the likelihood of exceptionally good health and a long\\nlife span, but most of us have one or two doshas predominant.', metadata={'source': 'Ayurveda.pdf', 'page': 23}),\n",

Your \\nprakruti\\n may, for example, be predominantly\\npitta, with vata secondary and a little kapha. (This can be written as V\\n2\\nP\\n3\\nK\\n1\\n.) For you,\\nmaintaining balance means keeping this proportion. If your vata or kapha should\\nincrease, moving toward an equal proportion of the doshas, it would not be healthy for\\nyou.\\nAs conditions change—due to weather, dietary choices, fatigue, stress, emotional\\nstate, exercise or lack of it—the balance of the doshas in our mind-body system also\\nchanges. This altered state of the doshas, reɻecting the current state of our health, is\\ncalled our \\nvikruti\\n. If your health is excellent, your current doshic status will be the same\\nas your \\nprakruti\\n. But more likely there will be a discrepancy, and it is this diʃerence\\nbetween the two that gives a direction for healing. Your aim will be to reestablish the\\nbalance indicated by your \\nprakruti\\n.\\nI know you are eager to ɹnd out what your constitution is, so let’s move on to that.\\nAfterward, we will look more deeply into the characteristics of each doshic type.\\nHow to Determine Your Constitutional Type\\nThe chart on \\nthis page\\n to \\nthis page\\n is a self-assessment that will enable you to\\ndetermine your unique constitution according to Ayurveda.\\nPlease remember that this can provide only a rough guideline.

(You might want to photocopy it, to\\nhave it available for others or for future use.) First, base your choices on what is most\\nconsistently \\ntrue about your life as a whole, over many years. This indicates your\\nprakruti\\n. Then ɹll it out a second time, considering how you have been feeling recently,\\nin the last month or two. This is your \\nvikruti\\n or present condition.\\nIt often helps to have a spouse or good friend verify your answers, as they may have\\ngood insights and some objectivity to offer as you make your responses.\\nAfter ɹlling out the chart, add up the number of marks under vata, pitta, and kapha', metadata={'source': 'Ayurveda.pdf', 'page': 24}),\n",

(We will discuss the eʃect of tastes in\\nchapter 8\\n.) Raw vegetables increase, rather than balance, vata. Vata individuals often\\nexperience digestive diɽculties and problems with absorption of nutrients. They tend to\\nproduce scanty urine, and their feces are hard, dry, and small in size and quantity.\\nConstipation is one of their most common ailments.\\nVatas are the most likely of the body types to fast or to eat very little, but this\\nactually increases vata and tends toward imbalance.\\nOther physical characteristics typical of vata types include small, recessed eyes,\\nwhich are often quite lusterless; dry, thin hair, often curly or kinky; dry, rough skin and\\nnails; cracking, popping joints; and teeth that may be irregular, broken, or protruding.\\nVatas walk quickly and are always in a rush.

It is\\nimportant to know where the patient was born and raised, and the time of onset\\nof the imbalance. It is also important to know the climate, customs, common\\nlocal diseases, diet, habits, likes and dislikes, strength, mental condition, etc.\\nThis enumeration opens the door to the wide variety of factors constantly inɻuencing\\nour health. Let us consider some of them.\\nLIKE INCREASES LIKE', metadata={'source': 'Ayurveda.pdf', 'page': 41}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='The ɹrst important principle in considering the potential causes of disease is “Like\\nincreases like.” A dosha is increased by experiences and inɻuences (such as food,\\nweather, and seasons) with qualities similar to it. Dry foods, dry fruit, running, jogging,\\njumping, always being in a rush, and working too hard are all factors that aggravate\\nvata in the system. Pittagenic factors, such as hot spicy food, citrus fruit, fermented\\nfood, and hot humid weather, provoke excess pitta. Cold, cloudy, damp weather, eating\\ndairy products, wheat, and meat, and sitting and doing nothing increase kapha.\\nThe antidote to “like increases like” is “opposite qualities decrease or balance.” This\\nis the key to healing.\\nNOTE\\n: In general, one’s \\nprakruti\\n indicates one’s disease proneness. Individuals\\nof pitta constitution, for example, tend to have pitta diseases. But this is not\\ninevitable. A person of vata constitution who eats a lot of hot spicy food, drinks\\nalcohol, lies in the sun, smokes cigarettes, and represses anger will deɹnitely get\\na pitta disease. If he or she eats candy, cookies, ice cream, and other dairy\\nproducts and is exposed to cold weather, there will be a susceptibility to\\ncongestive kapha disorders.\\nFOOD AND DIET\\nWe have already touched on the eʃects of food on the doshas, and \\nchapter 8\\n will\\ndiscuss this important topic in depth, so we won’t go into it at length here. The principle\\nis simply that eating the right kinds of food for your \\nprakruti\\n maintains vitality and\\nbalance, while eating the wrong kinds creates imbalance in the doshas, the ɹrst step in\\nthe genesis of disease.\\nEating spicy food or sour or citrus fruit and drinking alcohol all increase heat and\\nacidity in the body, something a pitta person cannot aʃord. For a vata individual, dried\\nfruits, beans (including garbanzo, pinto, and aduki) are hard to digest and will provoke\\nvata. Raw salads, which are cold and astringent, will likewise increase vata. For a\\nkapha individual, dairy products, cold drinks, and fatty fried foods deɹnitely add to\\nkapha. So a vata person eating a vatagenic diet, a pitta person eating a pitta-provoking\\ndiet, and a kapha person eating kapha-aggravating food are deɹnitely creating\\nimbalance and sowing the seeds for ill health.\\nWrong food combinations (see table \\nthis page\\n), stale food, food with chemical\\nadditives, and wrong eating habits, such as eating too much late at night or eating in a\\nrush, also contribute to imbalance and lead to poor digestion and poor health. Diet is\\nthus one of the main potential causes of ill health—but by understanding these\\nprinciples and eating according to the guidelines for our constitutional type, it is also\\none of the major ways we can take control of our lives and maintain healthy balance.\\nSEASONS', metadata={'source': 'Ayurveda.pdf', 'page': 42}),\n",

The predominant dosha of\\nthe season will tend to build up at that time and can cause aggravation especially in\\nsomeone of the same \\nprakruti\\n. If we act intelligently, we can avoid this accumulation and\\naggravation.\\nFor example, because autumn and early winter tend to increase vata, individuals\\nwith a vata-predominant constitution need to eat warm foods, dress warmly, avoid cold\\nfood and drinks, and stay out of nasty weather. Otherwise they will fall prey to vata\\nillnesses and discomforts, such as constipation, insomnia, and lower back pain. If pitta\\nindividuals want to remain free of anger, as well as hives, rash, and diarrhea, they need\\nto keep cool in the summer, avoiding spicy foods, overexertion, and overexposure to the\\nhot sun. Kaphas need care in the heart of winter and early spring if they are going to\\navoid colds, coughs, allergies, and sinus congestion in the damp, cool, heavy weather.\\nWe will look further at the seasons, their eʃects, and how we can best live in\\nharmony with their rhythms and changes in \\nchapter 5\\n, where we discuss the ideal\\nAyurvedic lifestyle, including daily and seasonal routines.\\nEXERCISE\\nExercise is another factor that can profoundly inɻuence your health for better or\\nworse. Regular exercise improves circulation and increases strength, stamina, and\\nimmunity. It helps one to relax and to sleep peacefully. It benefits the heart and lungs, is\\nvital for eʃective digestion and elimination, and helps the body purify itself of toxins\\nthrough sweating and deep breathing.

Children’s bodies are growing and building up their structure, so\\nkapha dosha is more predominant. Their bodies are soft and gentle (qualities of kapha),\\nthey require more sleep than adults, and they are susceptible to kapha illnesses such as\\ncolds and congestion.\\nAdulthood exhibits more characteristics of pitta. Adults are more competitive,\\naggressive, and ambitious than children; they work hard, they require less sleep, and\\nthey fall prey to pitta-type disorders such as gastritis, colitis, and peptic ulcers.\\nOld age is the age of vata. Elderly people sleep quite a bit less, and their sleep is\\nbroken. They tend to get constipation, cracking and popping of joints, degenerative\\ndiseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer’s disease, and suʃer from\\nforgetfulness, all characteristic of vata dosha.\\nThis shows that our age and stage of life are factors that have to be considered in the\\nchoices we make to keep our doshas in balance and remain healthy. Elderly people, for\\nexample, should not engage in strenuous exercise, and if possible they should minimize\\ntravel, among many factors that increase vata. They should favor a vata-balancing diet,\\nwith more warm, moist foods, more oil, and less salad and dried fruit.\\nMENTAL AND EMOTIONAL FACTORS\\nOur life is a whole, consisting of body, mind, and pure consciousness.

Fear, anger, grief, hatred, envy, possessiveness, and other negative emotions\\ndisturb our doshic balance; likewise, when the doshas are already out of balance, they\\nmay give rise to these same negative emotions.\\n• Increased vata is associated with anxiety, insecurity, fear, nervousness, restlessness,\\nconfusion, grief, and sadness.\\n• \\nIncreased pitta\\n is associated with anger, envy, hate, ambition, competitiveness,\\ncriticism, judgmental attitude, sharp speech, perfectionism, and the need to be in\\ncontrol.\\n• \\nIncreased kapha\\n is associated with greed, attachment, possessiveness, boredom,\\nlaziness, and lethargy.\\nEmotions have an aɽnity with certain organs: grief and sadness with the lungs,\\nanger with the liver, and hatred with the gall bladder.

Through ordinary\\nexperience our senses of taste, touch, smell, sight, and hearing can nourish us, and we\\ncan also ɹnd healing through sense therapies such as aromatherapy, color therapy,\\nmantras and other healing sounds, massage, and the tastes in herbs and foods.\\nBut because all our perceptions, as well as \\nour thoughts and feelings, are biochemical\\nevents as well as experiences in consciousness, improper use of the senses can create\\nimbalance or damage in the body and result in illness.\\nOveruse\\n of the senses strains and stresses our nervous system. To use a simple\\nexample, repeated exposure to bright light hurts the retina and strains the optic nerve,\\nwhich triggers pitta, and sooner or later a person’s eyesight will be aʃected or neuritis-\\nlike symptoms will arise. If we listen to loud music or hear loud sounds, the eardrum and\\nthe rest of our hearing apparatus are hurt and weakened; if it occurs often, the person\\ncan become deaf. Loud sounds also aʃect systemic vata dosha, giving rise to vata\\nsymptoms such as arthritis or degenerative changes in the bones. Lying in the sun strains\\nthe sense of touch, aggravates pitta, and may lead to skin cancer.\\nMisuse\\n of the senses means using them in a wrong way, such as trying to read very\\nsmall letters, or looking through a microscope or telescope (which creates a strain on the\\neyes), or reading while lying down (which changes the angle of focus and builds up\\nstress on the muscles of the eyeball), which will eventually result in pitta or vata\\ndisorders. Eating a large quantity of wrong food, such as hot, spicy, stimulating food\\ncontaining cayenne pepper, is a misuse of the taste organ. Listening to loud sounds over\\nthe telephone, and long phone conversations, both aggravate vata. Exposing the senses\\nto wrong inputs, such as watching violent movies on television, is also a misuse of the\\nsenses.\\nUnderuse\\n of the senses means not perceiving with total attention, ignoring what we\\nperceive, or not making full use of our wonderful sensory equipment.

SAD (seasonal aʃective disorder) is a form of depression that\\naʃects people who don’t get enough sunlight during the winter—a kind of underuse of\\nthe sense of sight. “Cabin fever,” the discomfort and restlessness born of staying indoors\\nfor a long time, is at least partly the result of sensory deprivation.

This is true even of such apparently\\nuncontrollable factors as the seasons and the weather: if it is cold, you can dress\\nwarmly; if it is hot, you can take it easy and stay out of the sun.\\nHow Disease Develops\\nAccording to Ayurveda, illness is the end result of a long process that can be detected\\nand addressed at any stage. This process has been thoroughly studied and its phases\\ndelineated in great detail.\\nThe disease process begins with disturbances in the balance of the doshas. Temporary\\nimbalances are common and quite normal; problems arise if the aggravated condition is\\nnot corrected. In the normal course of events, vata, pitta, and kapha go through cycles\\nof change in three stages: accumulation, provocation or aggravation, and paciɹcation.\\nPitta, for example, begins to build up and accumulate in the late spring. It is provoked\\nor aggravated in the hot summer months, and it naturally becomes paciɹed when the\\nweather cools down in the autumn.\\nIf the increased dosha isn’t paciɹed naturally through a change in seasons, it\\nundergoes further changes and disease may result. If a person with a predominantly\\nvata constitution experiences some degree of increased vata in the fall due to the cool,\\ndry, windy weather, but it returns to normal soon after, disease will not develop. The\\nperson can aid the process of restoring balance, for example, by eating moist, warming\\nfoods and dressing warmly in the windy weather.\\nHow to Transform Negative Feelings\\nNegative feelings can cause hurt both to ourselves and to others. If we express\\nanger or criticism, for example, we inɻict pain on someone else. On the other hand,\\nrepressing such feelings creates problems for ourselves, as the stressful biochemistry\\naffects the internal organs and systems down to the cellular level.\\nIf both expressing and holding back negative feelings can be harmful, what shall\\nwe do when these emotions boil up in us? Ayurveda oʃers a way to learn from such\\nsituations and resolve them in a positive manner.\\nAt the moment the feeling comes up, look into it. Let’s suppose it is a feeling of\\nanger. Take a long, deep breath, let yourself feel the anger, and exhale it out. Give\\nthe feeling total freedom to express itself \\nwithin you\\n, so that you look at it honestly\\nand feel it. Breathe into it, surrender to it, and be with it. Breathe into it, and\\nbreathe out. Soon it will dissolve by itself.', metadata={'source': 'Ayurveda.pdf', 'page': 48}),\n",

When awareness goes both ways, outer and inner, understanding is total. This\\napproach doesn’t put a scar on the mind.\\nLook at the feeling—any feeling or emotion—without labeling it or naming it.\\nThen the observer and the observed become one. Observe with total awareness,\\nwith no division between subject and object, no separation between yourself and\\nthe feeling. Give freedom to the feeling; let it flower; let it fade away.\\nIf the condition of aggravated vata continues, vata will move into the general\\ncirculation and into the deep connective tissue, where it will generate pathological\\nchanges. Disease will develop. Imbalance is disorder, and disorder is disease.\\nDisease is like a child. It has its own creation within the womb of the body, according\\nto a process known as \\nsamprapti\\n or pathogenesis, literally “the birth of pain.” In brief,\\nthis is how it happens:\\n1. ACCUMULATION\\nDue to various causes, such as diet, weather, seasons, emotions, and others we have\\ndiscussed, the doshas begin to accumulate in their respective sites: vata in the colon,\\npitta in the intestines, and kapha in the stomach. This is the easiest stage at which to\\ntreat any incipient health problem. A trained Ayurvedic physician can feel the\\nimbalance \\nin your pulse even at this stage, and you may be able to detect it yourself.\\nVata accumulation may be experienced as constipation, abdominal distension, or\\ngases in the colon. Pitta buildup may be felt as heat around the belly button area and\\ncan be observed as a slightly yellowish discoloration in the whites of the eyes, or dark\\nyellow-colored urine. The person will be very hungry and will crave candy and sugar.\\nAccumulated kapha leads to feelings of heaviness, lethargy, and loss of appetite.\\nAt this stage the individual is still quite healthy, and when a dosha starts to build up,\\nthe body’s intelligence creates an aversion to the causal factor and a craving for\\nopposite qualities, which can restore balance. For example, if you’ve eaten ice cream\\nthree days in a row and kapha is building up, the thought of more ice cream will not be\\nappealing; rather, your body will crave cayenne pepper or other spicy food to burn up\\nthe kapha and counteract it. One should listen to this wisdom and not continue\\nincreasing the cause.\\n2. AGGRAVATION\\nThe accumulated dosha continues to build up in its own site. The stomach gets\\nbrimmed up with kapha, the intestines ɹll with pitta, or the colon overɻows with vata.', metadata={'source': 'Ayurveda.pdf', 'page': 49}),\n",

Kapha tries to go up into\\nthe lungs, pitta tries to move into the stomach and gallbladder, and vata tries to move\\ninto the flanks.\\nYou can feel this stage, too. For example, if you eat too much kapha food on\\nSaturday night, you might feel full when you wake up on Sunday and think to yourself,\\n“Maybe I should fast or eat very lightly today.” But then someone invites you out for\\nSunday brunch, and you eat heavily again. The next day you might get a cough or a\\nfeeling of congestion in the lungs as the kapha starts to move upward. Excess pitta in\\nthe second stage may cause heartburn or acid indigestion, even nausea. Vata rising up\\nmay cause pain in the flanks or midback, or even breathlessness.\\nAccording to Ayurvedic therapeutics, the disease process can be addressed at any\\nstage, but speciɹc treatments are needed for speciɹc stages. In these ɹrst two stages,\\none can reverse the process by oneself, using common sense to apply the principle of\\nopposite qualities, and taking some home remedies. Once the disease process has gone\\nbeyond the gastrointestinal tract and entered the third phase, it is no longer under one’s\\nown control, and trained medical help is needed.

The central ɹre, called \\njatharagni\\n, governs the\\ndigestion and assimilation of food. The other agnis (the ɹre component in the cells,\\ntissues, and organs) perform the local process of digestion and nutrition. When agni\\nis robust and healthy, then whatever a person eats, the system digests, assimilates,\\nand absorbs it, then eliminates the impurities. But when the doshas are aggravated\\nbecause of poor diet, an unhealthy lifestyle, or negative emotions, they ɹrst aʃect\\nagni, which becomes unbalanced. When agni becomes weakened or disturbed, food\\nis not properly digested.\\nThe undigested, unabsorbed food particles accumulate in the gastrointestinal\\ntract and other subtle sites in the body and turn into a toxic, sticky, foul-smelling\\nsubstance called \\nama\\n.

DEPOSITION OR INFILTRATION\\nThe aggravated dosha enters an organ, tissue, or system that is weak or defective,\\ndue to previous trauma, genetic predisposition, accumulated emotional stress, repressed\\nemotions, or other factors. These weak areas in the body can be described as negative\\nlocations, like potholes in the road. Smoking cigarettes, for example, creates weakness\\nin the lungs; eating too much sugar creates weakness in the pancreas and blood tissue,\\nand so on.\\nThe newly arrived, aggravated humor (dosha) creates confusion within the cellular\\nintelligence of the weaker tissue and overwhelms it, changing its normal qualities and\\nfunctions.

That is why prevention is so strongly emphasized in Ayurvedic medicine. In this\\nchapter we will consider some of the fundamental principles and approaches\\nrecommended by Ayurveda for remaining healthy.\\nAwareness\\nThe master key to remaining healthy is \\nawareness\\n. If you know your constitution, and\\nyou can remain alert to how your mind, body, and emotions respond to the changing\\nconditions in your environment and the numerous facets of your daily life, such as the\\nfood you eat, you can make informed choices to maintain good health.\\nAs we saw in \\nchapter 3\\n, the cause is the concealed eʃect and the eʃect is the\\nrevealed cause, as the seed contains the potential tree and the tree reveals the potency\\nof the seed. To treat the cause is to treat the eʃect, to prevent it from coming to fruition.\\nIf a kapha person always has kapha problems in the spring season, such as hay fever,\\ncolds, congestion, sinus headaches, and weight gain, such a person should watch his diet\\nand eliminate kapha-producing food like wheat, watermelon, cucumber, yogurt, cheese,\\ncandy, ice cream, and cold drinks. (Ice is not good for a kapha person; it will produce\\ncongestive disorders.)\\nThe knowledge of the causes of disease, and the understanding that “like increases\\nlike” and “opposites balance,” give us all the information we need to maintain or restore\\nour health, simply through conscious attention, moment-to-moment awareness of our\\nbehavior.\\nIf I am living consciously, I may observe that after I ate yogurt two weeks ago, I felt\\ncongested and a cold developed. Then it cleared up and I was okay for a few days.\\nWhen yogurt comes my way again, the memory will come up and my body will say,\\n“Hey, last time you ate yogurt, you got sick!” If I bring lively awareness and listen to my\\nbody, it will tell me, “I don’t want yogurt.” To listen to the body’s wisdom, the body’s\\nintelligence, is to be aware, and this is one of the most effective ways to prevent disease.\\nDeveloping an awareness of the potential causes of imbalance, and of one’s moment-\\nto-moment state of well-being, is the necessary ɹrst step to maintaining health.

       " Document(page_content='second step is taking action.\\nTaking Action to Modify the Cause\\nYou can’t control the weather, but you can dress properly, so that cold winds, or\\nrain, or summer’s heat will not aggravate the doshas. Changes in the weather are a\\npotential cause of doshic imbalance. Windy, cold, dry weather will aggravate vata\\ndosha; hot, sticky weather is sure to provoke pitta; cold, cloudy, wet weather will\\nincrease kapha dosha. Once we have knowledge and understanding, it is time to take\\naction. Put on a hat, a scarf, a warm coat; stay out of direct sunlight. Modify the cause.\\nPotential causes of illness and imbalance are constantly arising, both within us and\\non the outside. The weather is changing, our surroundings are changing, our thoughts\\nand feelings are changing, and stressful situations are coming and going. In response to\\nthese changes, we have to act skillfully. As the Bhagavad Gita says, “Skill in action is\\ncalled \\nyoga\\n.”\\nI have to be smart enough to know my previous history and to learn from it. When I\\neat garbanzos, I get a stomachache, so \\nthis\\n time I should not eat them. Or if there is\\nnothing to eat except garbanzos, then I can add cumin powder, ghee, and a little\\nmustard seed, and it will be suitable for me to eat. The garbanzos’ dry, light vatagenic\\neffect will be modified by the moist, oily ghee and the warming spices.\\nA substantial part of the Ayurvedic pharmacy is the Ayurvedic art of cooking. Adding\\nspeciɹc seasonings changes the property of food and can cause a “forbidden” food, one\\nthat might have provoked imbalance, to become acceptable. Some people, for example,\\nare sensitive to potatoes. Potatoes give them gas and little aches and pains in the\\nmuscles and around the joints. But if they peel oʃ the skin and sauté the potato with\\nghee and a little turmeric, mustard seed, cumin powder, and cilantro, it mitigates the\\nvata-provoking property of the potato and the body can then handle it. One can take\\naction to modify the cause; the body’s response will be diʃerent, and that particular\\ncausative factor will not have an adverse effect.\\nThis principle applies equally well to psychological factors. You may know that\\nwatching violent movies upsets you and \\ngives you nightmares. The violent imagery\\ndisturbs your doshic balance, provoking anxiety and fear. You have observed this\\nhappening to you; the next time you are confronted with the “opportunity” to subject\\nyourself to a violent movie, you can just say no.\\nIt keeps coming down to the same central issue: consciousness, awareness, ɹnding\\nout, “What is my role in this situation?

The second step is taking\\naction to modify causes you can’t avoid or control (such as the weather). The next step is\\nto restore balance once it begins to be lost. The main method for doing this is to apply\\nthe opposite quality or qualities.\\nIf you’re cold, have some hot soup or take something warm to drink. If you’re\\nagitated or upset (perhaps you watched that violent movie against your better\\njudgment), sit down and do some meditation to calm your mind and emotions.

What if you haven’t taken\\nthe opportunity to develop awareness, to modify the cause, or to apply opposite\\nqualities to restore balance, and you have begun to get sick? What to do now?\\nThe principle of opposites is almost universally valid and helpful at any stage of\\ndisease. But once disease has begun to develop, it will not be suɽcient. At this stage it\\nbecomes necessary to use techniques for cleansing and purifying your body of excess\\ndoshas and accumulated toxins.\\nAs we have seen, when the doshas are aggravated because of poor diet, unhealthy\\nlifestyle, negative emotions, or other factors, they ɹrst aʃect agni (the body’s biological\\nɹre, which governs digestion and assimilation). When agni becomes weakened or\\ndisturbed, food is not properly digested. The undigested, unabsorbed food particles\\naccumulate in the gastrointestinal tract and turn into the toxic, sticky substance called\\nama. In the third (“spread”) stage of the disease process, ama clogs the intestines,\\noverɻows through other bodily channels such as the blood vessels, and inɹltrates the\\nbodily tissues, causing disease.\\nAma is thus the root cause of disease. The presence of ama in the system can be felt\\nas fatigue, or a feeling of heaviness. It may induce constipation, indigestion, gas, and\\ndiarrhea, or it may generate bad breath, a bad taste in the mouth, stiʃness in the body,\\nor mental confusion. Ama can most \\neasily be detected as a thick coating on the tongue.\\nAccording to Ayurveda, disease is actually a crisis of ama, in which the body seeks to\\neliminate the accumulated toxicity.

       " Document(page_content='programs. One of these, most widely known in the West, is a ɹve-procedure program\\nknown as \\npanchakarma\\n (“ɹve actions”). The \\npanchakarma\\n programs used at Ayurvedic\\ntreatment centers include prepuriɹcation methods to prepare the body to let go of the\\ntoxins, followed by the purification methods themselves.\\nThe ɹrst preparatory step is internal oleation. The patient is asked to drink a\\nspeciɹc, small quantity of ghee (clariɹed butter) every day for several days. The ghee\\ncreates a thin ɹlm in the body’s channels that lubricates them, allowing the ama lodged\\nin the deep connective tissues to move freely, without sticking to the channels, to the\\ngastrointestinal tract for elimination. Internal oleation is done for three to ɹve days or\\neven longer, depending on the individual circumstances.\\nThis is followed by external oleation in the form of oil massage (\\nsnehana\\n) and\\nsweating (\\nswedana\\n). Oil is applied to the entire body with a particular kind of massage\\nthat helps the toxins move toward the gastrointestinal tract. The massage also softens\\nboth the superɹcial and deep tissues, helping to relieve stress and to nourish the nervous\\nsystem. Then the individual is given a steam bath, which further loosens the toxins and\\nincreases their movement toward the gastrointestinal tract.\\nAfter three to seven days of these procedures, the doshas will have become well\\n“ripened.” At this point the physician will determine that the patient is ready to\\neliminate the aggravated doshas and accumulated ama. One of the ɹve \\nkarmas\\n or\\nactions is selected as the most expedient route to eliminate the excess doshas. These\\nprocedures may include:\\n• therapeutic vomiting (\\nvamana\\n) to remove toxins and excess kapha from the\\nstomach;\\n• purgation or laxative therapy (\\nvirechana\\n) to help remove ama and excess pitta from\\nthe small intestines, colon, kidneys, stomach, liver, and spleen;\\n• medicated enema therapy (\\nbasti\\n) to help remove excess vata from the colon.\\nAggravated vata is one of the main etiological factors in the manifestation of diseases.

Regularity in\\nsleeping, waking, eating, and eliminating, indeed following a regular daily routine,\\nbrings discipline to life and helps maintain the integrity of the doshas.\\nOur body is a clock. Or rather, it is several clocks at once. According to Ayurveda,\\nevery organ has a deɹnite time of maximum functioning. Morning time is the lung time.\\nMidday is stomach time, when we feel hungry. Afternoon is liver time, and late\\nafternoon is when the colon and kidneys operate at their peak.\\nThis biological clock works in conjunction with the doshic clock. Morning and\\nevening (dawn and dusk) are the times when the inɻuence of vata is greatest.

Again in the late afternoon, from about 2 \\nP.M\\n. until sunset, the\\ninfluence of vata makes one feel light and active.\\nEarly morning and evening are kapha times. From sunrise until about 10 \\nA.M\\n., kapha\\nmakes one feel fresh but a little heavy. Then again in the evening, from about 6 \\nP.M\\n. until\\naround 10, kapha ushers in a period of cooling air, inertia, and declining energy.\\nMidday and midnight are pitta times. At midmorning, kapha slowly merges into\\npitta, and by noon one feels hungry and ready for lunch.

Coconut oil is calming, cooling, and soothing\\nto the skin.\\n• Wear cotton or silk clothing; it is cooling, \\nlight, and allows the skin to breathe.\\nLoose-fitting clothes are best; they permit the air to pass through and cool the body.\\n• The best colors to wear in hot weather are white, gray, blue, purple, and green.\\nAvoid red, orange, dark yellow, and black, which absorb and retain heat and will\\naggravate pitta.\\n• Follow the pitta-pacifying diet from the food guidelines in \\nchapter 8\\n. Good fruits for\\nsummer include apples, pears, melons, plums, and prunes. Watermelon and lime juice\\nare also good in summer. Try steamed asparagus, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cucumber\\nraita, and basmati rice. Kitchari made of basmati rice and mung dal, with a little ghee\\nand grated coconut, makes a delicious light meal. Avoid sour fruits, citrus fruits, and\\neven beets and carrots, which are all heating. Garlic, onion, chili, tomato, sour cream,\\nand salted cheeses are also not recommended. You can eat more salads in summer than\\nat any other time, as they are cooling, but they are best eaten for lunch. If you eat meat,\\nyou can have some light meat—chicken, turkey, or shrimp—once a week. Avoid dark\\nmeats, which are heating.\\n• Don’t drink hot water or hot drinks in the summer. Room-temperature or cool\\ndrinks are best. Ice and iced drinks, however, inhibit digestion and create toxins (ama)\\nin the body; it is best never to drink them.\\n• A refreshing drink is cool lassi.

You can add ¼ teaspoon roasted cumin seed before blending, or\\nfor a sweet-ɻavored drink, add 2 tablespoons Sucanat or other sweetener and 1 drop of\\nrose water. The juice of ¼ lime in a cup of cool water with a pinch of cumin powder is\\nalso refreshing.\\n• Working in a hot kitchen provokes pitta. If you cook, cook in the early morning or\\nin the evening.

It is the constant\\nmovement of awareness. \\nPrana\\n carries awareness to the object of our\\nperception; that movement of awareness through \\nprana\\n is called attention. The internal\\nmovement of \\nprana\\n is the movement of sensation, thought, feeling, and emotion. Thus\\nprana\\n and mind are deeply connected.\\nThe physical manifestation of \\nprana\\n is breath. Breathing and mind are closely\\nconnected. Ayurveda says that breathing is the physical part of thinking and thinking is\\nthe psychological part of breathing. Every thought changes the rhythm of breath, and\\nevery breath changes the rhythm of thinking. When one is happy, blissful, and silent,\\nbreathing is rhythmic. If one is disturbed with anxiety, fear, or nervousness, the\\nbreathing is irregular and interrupted.\\nAncient Vedic seers (\\nrishis\\n) discovered this intimate relationship between breathing\\nand mental activity and uncovered the art of \\npranayama. Pranayama\\n equals \\nprana\\n plus\\nayam. Ayam\\n means “to control,” \\nprana\\n is “breath.” By controlling the breath, we can\\ncontrol mental activity.\\nThe Secret of Pranayama\\nThe \\nrishis\\n also found an intimate relationship between the right and the left breath\\ncycle. You may have noticed that sometimes you breathe more easily through the left\\nnostril, and sometimes your breathing shifts more to the right nostril. This shift happens\\nabout every 45 to 90 minutes. Just as the right side of our body is governed by the left\\nside of the brain and vice versa, breathing better through the left nostril activates the\\nright hemisphere of the brain, and breathing better through the right nostril activates the\\nleft brain.\\nThe left brain is associated with male energy, the right with female energy. The left\\nbrain is for logical thinking, investigation, inquiry, aggressiveness, competition, and\\njudgment. Whenever we are judging, investigating, and so on, our right breath cycle is\\ndominant and our left brain hemisphere is operating. Exactly opposite, when the right\\nhemisphere is acting and the left breath cycle is working, we have female energy, which\\nis associated with love, compassion, intuition, art, poetry, and religion. So when an\\nartist is drawing a picture or a poet writing a poem, he or she is using some part of the\\nright brain. And when the scientist is working in the lab, investigating and solving a\\nproblem, at that time he or she is using some part of the left brain.', metadata={'source': 'Ayurveda.pdf', 'page': 80}),\n",

Health-\\nconscious people today are interested in the role good nourishment can play in their\\nhealing and in their health. Many have come to realize that proper food and diet can\\nmake a vital contribution to good health, while inappropriate eating is often responsible\\nfor poor health, lack of vitality, and susceptibility to disease.\\nThe Ayurvedic tradition oʃers much insight into what food will suit and balance each\\nindividual, how to prepare and cook this food properly, how to avoid food combinations\\nthat will create toxins in the body, and what eating habits to cultivate—and which to\\navoid—in order to receive the most nourishment from what you eat. All these topics,\\nexcept speciɹc guidelines on how to prepare and cook the food, will be discussed in this\\nchapter. (Interested readers may consult \\nAyurvedic Cooking for Self-Healing\\n by Usha Lad\\nand Dr. Vasant Lad, a complete reference guide to Ayurvedic cooking, including spices\\nand herbs, healing qualities of common foods, menu planning, and dozens of delicious\\nrecipes.)\\nFood Guidelines for the Constitutional Types\\nWhat you eat should be suited to your individual constitution. Ideally, in deciding\\nwhat to eat, you would know your constitution and understand its relationship to the\\nqualities of various kinds of food, including whether each food would be helpful or\\naggravating to your unique doshic balance. You would have to take into account the\\ntaste of the food (we will discuss that issue later in this chapter), and whether its\\nqualities \\nare heavy or light, oily or dry, liquid or solid. You would also have to know\\nwhether the food is cooling or heating (\\nvirya\\n), and its postdigestive effect (\\nvipaka\\n).\\nIf you are interested, you can go more deeply into Ayurvedic theory in order to fully\\ncomprehend these factors (see the \\nReading List\\n). Otherwise, the following charts take\\nthese factors into consideration in recommending what foods to eat or avoid.\\nThe charts categorize foods according to their suitability for each doshic type. Here\\nare a few points to remember:\\n• Foods marked “no” tend to aggravate that particular dosha, while foods marked\\n“yes” pacify or balance that dosha. In planning your diet, choose foods that create\\nbalance, and avoid those that might provoke your predominant doshas or the dosha that\\nis currently aggravated or increased.', metadata={'source': 'Ayurveda.pdf', 'page': 90}),\n",

If a food is\\non your “no” list, that means you should avoid it most of the time, and if you eat it, eat\\na modest amount or do something to modify its eʃects. Apples, for example, are quite\\nvata-provoking if eaten raw. But if you cook them and eat them warm, with a little ghee\\nand warming spices such as cardamom or cinnamon, they are ɹne for vata individuals\\nin modest amounts.\\n• Keep the seasons in mind. Summer, for example, is pitta season, and it is not good\\n—especially for people with a predominantly pitta constitution—to eat too many hot,\\nspicy foods, or pitta dosha will become aggravated. Similarly, during autumn, when the\\nair is dry and cool and more vata is present in the atmosphere, everyone—but especially\\nindividuals with a vata constitution—should avoid dry fruit, salads, cold foods, and other\\nvata-provoking items. In winter and early spring, the heavy, cold, moist season of\\nkapha, one should make an extra eʃort to avoid cold food and drinks, ice cream, cheese,\\nyogurt, melons, and other kaphaincreasing foods.\\n• For individuals with a dual constitution (two doshas approximately equal), a little\\nextra care is needed, but you can ɹgure it out. For example, a vata-pitta individual\\nneeds to avoid vata-increasing foods in the fall and winter (but without increasing pitta\\ntoo much) and minimize pitta-provoking foods in the summer (but without aggravating\\nvata).

It promotes stability.\\nDespite all these good qualities, excessive use of the sweet taste can produce many\\ndisorders. Sweet foods aggravate kapha and cause colds, cough, congestion, heaviness,\\nloss of appetite, laziness, and obesity. They may also provoke lymphatic congestion,\\ntumors, edema, diabetes, and fibrocystic changes in the breast.\\nSOUR\\nThe sour taste is found in foods such as citrus fruits, sour cream, yogurt, vinegar,\\ncheese, lemon, green grapes, and fermented food. Sour substances are liquid, light,\\nheating, and oily in nature.

That is why Ayurvedic herbs are\\ngenerally taken in a form that requires tasting them, rather than concealing the\\ntaste in a capsule.\\nThere is no problem in taking an herb that has a sweet, pungent, or otherwise\\ntempting taste. But most people, particularly in Western culture, don’t like the\\nbitter or astringent tastes, and if they have to take an herb with either of these\\ntastes, they want to put the herb into a capsule and swallow it without tasting it.\\nSince the stomach has no taste buds, when the herb is taken this way, the eʃects\\nand beneɹts derived from the taste are lessened, because they are not perceived.\\nWhen we eat food, we don’t lose the eʃect of the tastes because we have to chew;\\nwhen we use capsules, we miss the taste of the herb.\\nOne of the reasons the Ayurvedic physician prescribes an herb is to balance\\nwhatever taste is lacking in the body.

Gradually, from eating these\\nfoods, the mind becomes more \\nrajasic\\n, which means it tends toward anger, hate, and\\nmanipulation.\\nTamasic\\n food is heavy, dull, and depressing and induces deep sleep.

At the same time, Vedic philosophy teaches that there is a\\nconcurrent and inherent relationship between the macrocosm (the universe) and the\\nmicrocosm (the individual). The individual is constantly exposed to environmental\\nchanges, seasonal changes, changes in diet, lifestyle, emotions, job, ɹnancial status, and\\nrelationships. These changes are constantly bombarding every human being. To remain\\nhealthy or to regain health, all these factors have to be taken into consideration.\\nAs you have learned, when the body’s doshic balance of vata–pitta–kapha is\\ndisturbed, illness may result. The purpose of Ayurvedic healing is not just to relieve the\\nsymptoms of a specific illness but to bring the out-of-balance factors back into harmony.\\nThus, the purpose of Ayurvedic remedies, whether they be herbal medications,\\ndietary and nutritional changes, yoga postures, cleansing procedures, or breathing\\nexercises, is to eradicate the underlying causes of the disease, not merely to remove the\\nsymptoms. Of course one must deal directly with emergency or life-threatening\\nsymptoms, such as wheezing in asthma, heart pain in heart conditions, or high fever in\\ninfections. But if the fundamental causes of the illness are not dealt with, the problem\\nwill manifest again in the same or another form.\\nComponents of Ayurvedic Healing\\nThe Ayurvedic approach to restoring health is known as \\nchikitsa\\n (disease\\nmanagement) and traditionally consists of eight components. \\nIf you glance at the\\naccompanying box, you will note that \\nchikitsa\\n is a complete healing program that begins\\nwith identifying and eliminating the underlying cause of the illness, proceeds by\\npurifying the body and reestablishing balance, and ends with strengthening and\\nrevitalizing the affected organs, tissues, and systems so that the disease will not recur.\\nIf you become sick, your illness is not likely to become completely healed unless you\\nchange the behaviors that gave rise to it. Dietary indiscretions, a stressful lifestyle,\\nunresolved emotions, insuɽcient exercise—these are some of the factors that are at the\\nroot of most illness. Identifying and eliminating these causal factors are essential\\ncomponents of the healing process. If you take some of the recommended herbal\\nformulas but allow unhealthy lifestyle habits to continue unabated, it’s not likely that\\nyou will experience lasting or significant improvement.\\nThat is why, for each condition, I have suggested not only medications but numerous\\nother measures you can use for healing, such as speciɹc yoga postures and breathing\\nexercises, foods to favor or avoid, massage oils, teas, healing pastes, and many other\\nways to promote healing.

The pharmacopoeia of Ayurveda is vast, including literally\\nthousands of medicines, many of them herbal preparations. For each condition listed\\nhere, I have tried to include several very simple remedies, utilizing common kitchen\\nherbs or household strategies such as taking a warm bath. I also recommend some\\ncommon Ayurvedic herbs, most of which are easily obtained from various sources (see\\nResources\\n). For guidelines on how to prepare your own herbal formulas, how to take\\nherbs, how to make ghee, and other important information, please see \\nappendix 2\\n.\\nSEE WHAT WORKS\\n. For each condition, several suggestions are made. No one expects you to\\nuse all of them. Try what sounds good to you, and observe how it works. If it solves the\\nproblem, you don’t need to try any others. If it doesn’t seem to work, then try a different\\napproach. Each person is different and will react differently to these remedies.\\nDON’T BE DISCOURAGED IF A REMEDY DOESN’T WORK\\n. In self-treatment using Ayurvedic principles and\\nremedies, keep in mind a fundamental therapeutic guideline. If you diagnose your\\nproblem to be, for example, a vata disorder and embark on a treatment to reduce vata,\\nthen ɹnd that the treatment is not working or appears to be exacerbating the problem,\\nthis indicates that your diagnosis was not entirely correct.\\nThis does not mean you should give up on Ayurvedic remedies! Simply try using the\\ntreatment recommended for either pitta or kapha, whichever makes more sense to you\\nconsidering your symptoms. If you are untrained in Ayurvedic diagnosis, you may\\nsimply have made a mistake. So use your best judgment and try again.\\nSometimes the eʃect of the ɹrst remedy can give you a clue for a more beneɹcial\\ntreatment. For example, perhaps you thought your condition was due to excess kapha,\\nand you decided to use a heating herb \\nsuch as ginger, pepper, or \\ntrikatu\\n to treat it. If the\\ncondition worsens and you develop symptoms of aggravated pitta, such as irritability or\\na skin rash, you can infer that perhaps the problem was actually related to excess pitta.\\nReassess the situation, and take the next step.\\nBE SURE TO TREAT YOUR ACTUAL CONDITION\\n. Most imbalances and illnesses are related to\\nconstitution. As it is often said, “\\nPrakruti\\n indicates disease proneness.” Vata individuals\\nare likely to have vata-related problems, pitta individuals will have primarily pitta\\nconditions, and kaphas will have kapha illnesses.\\nHowever, in a small percentage of cases, your illness or condition may not coincide\\nwith your own constitutional type. For example, you may be predominantly a pitta\\ntype, but you may have a vata condition such as insomnia or constipation. It may be the\\nresult of any combination of vata-aggravating factors in your life, such as a vata diet, a\\ncold dry climate, or irregular hours. So when remedies are suggested, be careful to\\nchoose options that fit the symptoms of your \\ncondition\\n, not necessarily your body type.\\nHOW LONG TO TAKE A REMEDY\\n.

How long have you\\nhad it? How motivated are you to get well?\\nFirst, assess your desire to get well. If you have a strong desire and are motivated to\\nget results, the ɹrst thing you need is diligence in following the prescribed Ayurvedic\\nregimen. Because of the law of \\nkarma\\n (cause and eʃect), to a great extent you will\\nderive benefits according to your own actions. So in addition to taking your herbs two or\\nthree times a day as recommended (no skipping, no forgetting them at home …), you\\nalso need to address the underlying causes of your condition by rethinking your diet,\\ndaily routine, exercise program, etc. Chances are that the herbal remedies alone, without\\nsome changes in your lifestyle, will not be powerful enough to override the very\\nbehavior patterns that caused the illness in the first place.\\nIf your condition is serious, and you are diligent with your remedies and make\\nappropriate lifestyle changes and still the symptoms persist, you need to see your doctor\\nfor help. On the other hand, if the condition is chronic, it is unrealistic to expect that\\nsomething that has persisted for years is going to disappear in a week or a month.\\nSo in deciding how long to use the recommended remedies, use your common sense.\\nAnd do your best right from the start: If you don’t, and you end up not getting the\\nresults you would like, it’s human nature that you will question whether you could have\\ndone better.\\nEvery disease process in the body, and every process of healing, has its own\\nmomentum, speed, and duration.

A vata allergy may lead to sudden wheezing, sneezing,\\nheadache, ringing in the ears, or insomnia. For example, some individuals, when\\nexposed to dust or pollen, suddenly start wheezing. The wheezing is due to narrowing of\\nthe bronchial tree due to vata dosha. That person may also experience insomnia and\\nother vata-type symptoms.\\n• \\nIn a pitta type of allergy\\n, pitta dosha is already present under the skin. If the person\\ncomes in contact with an allergen, such as chemicals, ragweed, or certain synthetic\\nɹbers, then the pitta penetrates through the capillaries due to its hot and sharp qualities\\nand creates a rash, itching, hives, urticaria, allergic dermatitis, or eczema—all pitta-type\\nallergic reactions.\\n• \\nKapha allergies\\n are often experienced during spring season, when plants and trees\\nshed their pollens into the atmosphere. When the pollens, such as juniper or any other\\nɻower pollen, are inhaled, they enter the nasal-respiratory passage, and in some people\\nthey irritate the delicate mucous membrane, leading to hay fever, colds, congestion, a\\ncough, sinus infection, and even asthma.\\nIn order to treat allergies eʃectively, ɹrst we have to ɹnd out whether it is vata,\\npitta, or kapha type. Then we can determine the specific line of treatment.\\nIn most cases, perhaps 80 percent, your \\nprakruti\\n (constitution) predicts your allergy\\nproneness. That is, there is usually a correspondence between a person’s constitution\\nand the type of allergic reaction. A person of pitta \\nprakruti\\n is more likely to have a pitta\\nallergic reaction, especially when the \\nvikruti\\n or current status of the system shows a pitta\\nimbalance.

To make use of it\\ntoday, you might consider donating about ½ pint or 100 cc. of blood to a blood bank.\\nThat will help to defuse pitta conditions such as allergic dermatitis and allergic eczema.\\n• To produce a similar eʃect, you can use a blood-cleansing herbal combination.

Kapha allergies generally take the form of respiratory-pulmonary\\ncongestion, cough, cold, asthma, or hay fever. For relief from these conditions, use the\\nfollowing herbal formula:\\nsitopaladi 4 parts\\nyashti madhu 4 parts\\nabrak bhasma ⅛ part\\nTake about ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with honey.\\nPURGATION THERAPY\\n. Kapha-type allergies occur when excess kapha collects in the stomach\\nand lungs. One way to relieve this congestion is purgation therapy (\\nvirechana\\n). \\nUse\\nɻaxseed oil (available in most natural food stores), and take 1 teaspoon 2 or 3 times a\\nday for 2 or 3 days. This will be quite effective. Or you can use \\ntriphala\\n (see below).\\nVOMITING THERAPY\\n. The Ayurvedic therapy that is particularly eʃective for removing\\nexcess kapha from the stomach and respiratory tract is \\nvamana\\n, or vomiting therapy. I\\nhave noticed, however, that people in the West have a strong cultural bias against\\nvomiting, and many seem particularly uncomfortable with this procedure. It not only\\nseems physically repugnant but may be emotionally diɽcult as well, as some emotional\\npuriɹcation may arise as a result of the physical puriɹcation. So if you tend to have\\nstrong emotions or have trouble dealing with them, it might be better for you not to try\\nvamana\\n.\\nIf you want to try it—and I want to emphasize that it is very effective for eliminating\\nexcess kapha—the procedure is to drink a stomach full of licorice tea and salt water and\\nthen to regurgitate it, emptying the stomach. Start by drinking several cups of licorice\\ntea, followed by a pint of water with about 1 teaspoon of salt mixed in. Drink enough to\\nfill your stomach, then rub the back of the tongue and vomit it out.\\nIMPORTANT CAUTION\\n: If you have high blood pressure, low blood pressure, hiatal\\nhernia, or a history of heart problems, do not do \\nvaman\\n therapy.', metadata={'source': 'Ayurveda.pdf', 'page': 122}),\n",

(See \\nappendix 2\\n for instructions for preparing \\ntriphala\\n.) \\nTriphala\\n acts as both a\\nlaxative and a purgative. It consists of three herbs: \\namalaki, bibhitaki\\n, and \\nharitaki.\\nHaritaki\\n works on vata dosha, \\namalaki\\n on pitta dosha, and \\nbibhitaki\\n on kapha dosha.\\nDIETARY CHANGES\\n. For vata allergy, follow a vata-soothing diet; for pitta type of allergy,\\nthe pitta-pacifying diet; and for kapha allergy, the kapha-reducing diet. (Diet guidelines\\nmay be found in \\nchapter 8\\n.)\\nWATCH YOUR FOOD COMBINATIONS\\n. It is important for individuals with allergies not to eat\\nincompatible food combinations, such as milk and yogurt, meat and dairy, poultry and\\ndairy, melon and grains, or fruits and grains. Avoid such things as banana milk shakes\\nand “fruit smoothies” made with milk. For a more complete list of food incompatibilities,\\nplease turn to \\nthis page\\n.\\nAVOID THE CAUSE\\n. For most allergies, one should try to avoid the immediate cause: the\\nallergen. People who are allergic to cats, dogs, hair, pollen, mold, and so on should\\nsimply try to avoid them. Also try to stay away from synthetic ɹbers such as polyester\\nand rayon, which can cause pitta-type skin allergies. It is best to wear cotton clothing.\\nBecause of the large quantity of pesticides routinely sprayed on cotton, you might\\nconsider using only organic cotton \\nproducts, though they tend to be more expensive.\\nBLOCK THE ALLERGENS\\n. Generally, the respiratory passage is open to dust and other\\nallergens. One way to minimize the eʃect of allergens that you can’t avoid is to\\nlubricate the nasal mucous membrane with ghee. This prevents direct contact of the\\nallergen with the mucous membrane.\\nUSE NEEM OIL\\n. Another way to reduce or avoid the eʃect of environmental allergens is to\\napply \\nneem\\n oil to the exposed part of the body. The presence of the oil on the skin, as\\nwell as the disinfectant properties of \\nneem\\n, will minimize contact with the allergen.\\nNOTE\\n: Use \\nneem\\n herbalized oil—that is, \\nneem\\n leaves cooked in a base of sesame\\nor another oil. Pure \\nneem\\n extract will be too strong. If you ɹnd that even this\\nherbalized \\nneem\\n oil is too strong and creates an itching or burning sensation,\\nmix it half and half with coconut oil.\\nMEDITATE FOR STRESS REDUCTION\\n. Most allergies are stress related. Because of stress, imbalance\\nis created in mind and body. The practice known as Empty Bowl meditation helps to\\nrestore balance and thus helps take care of stress-related allergies. (See \\nchapter 7\\n for\\nguidelines.)\\nYOGA POSTURES\\n. The most helpful yoga \\nasana\\n for kapha and vata allergies is the Sun\\nSalutation. For pitta allergies, do the Moon Salutation.

Also, \\nujjayi pranayama\\n helps to improve immunity\\nand is beneficial for all types of allergies.\\n \\nAnemia\\n \\nModern medicine has delineated several types of anemia: iron-deɹciency anemia,\\npernicious anemia, sickle-cell anemia, and hypoproteinemic anemia (lack of protein in\\nthe blood), as well as certain vitamin-deɹciency anemias, such as B-12 and folic acid-\\ndeɹciency anemia. Certain bleeding disorders, such as profuse menstrual bleeding,\\nbleeding hemorrhoids, or bleeding gums, can lead to anemia because of blood loss.\\nWhenever modern medicine deals with the problem of anemia, it considers all these\\netiological factors.\\nAyurveda looks at anemia quite diʃerently. Ayurvedic classiɹcation of anemia falls\\nunder three basic doshic conditions: vata type, pitta type, and kapha type. It doesn’t\\nmatter whether a person has iron deɹciency or folic acid deɹciency; what is important is\\nhow the anemia is expressing itself through a particular individual. As it turns out (see\\nbox \\nthis page\\n), there is also a correspondence between the Ayurvedic interpretation and\\nthe understanding according to modern medicine.\\nTYPES OF ANEMIA\\n• In vata-type anemia, the person looks thin, with dry, rough, scaly skin, and has\\ncracking of the joints. He or she looks emaciated and pale, may suʃer from\\nbreathlessness and constipation, and may pass tarry black stool.\\n• In pitta-type anemia, the eyes are slightly yellowish, the person may get high-\\ncolored urine, and the stools are dark brown or have a slightly yellowish tinge. There\\nmay be nausea or pain in the liver and/or spleen area. Dizziness or vertigo may be\\nexperienced, and the person may become easily irritated by light.\\n• In kapha-type anemia, there is often swelling (edema), and the person’s skin feels\\ncold and clammy and looks shiny. Because of the edema, the skin gets stretched so much\\nthat you can often see the reflection of the window on it.\\nBy careful observation one can tell whether the anemia is vata, pitta, or kapha type.\\nBy treating that dosha, one treats the root cause and can alleviate the anemia.\\nTREATMENT\\nFOR VATA-TYPE ANEMIA\\n. For vata anemia, Ayurveda suggests taking \\ntikta ghrita\\n, which is', metadata={'source': 'Ayurveda.pdf', 'page': 124}),\n",

It is called \\ngandharva haritaki\\n, which is \\nharitaki\\n powder\\nroasted in castor oil in an iron pan. Place 1 tablespoon castor oil in an iron pan and\\nheat on the stove; when the oil is warm enough, sauté 1 ounce of the herb \\nharitaki\\n. The\\nharitaki\\n will become thick and will turn slightly brown. (You have to stir it.) Take ½\\nteaspoon of \\ngandharva haritaki\\n at bedtime, washed down with warm water. Take it for 2\\nmonths or until the blood returns to normal.\\nNOTE\\n: This mixture may cause loose stools; if this happens, reduce your dosage\\nuntil comfortable.\\nFOR PITTA-TYPE ANEMIA\\n. For pitta anemia, Ayurveda suggests \\nshatavari\\n ghee. (The \\nshatavari\\nand the ghee are cooked together. Directions for preparing herbalized and medicated\\nghees and oils appear in \\nappendix 2\\n.) Take 1 teaspoon of \\nshatavari\\n ghee 3 times a day,\\nbefore breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\\n• One can also use this herbal formula:\\nshatavari 5 parts\\nbrahmi 3 parts\\nneem 2 parts\\nloha bhasma ⅛ part\\nMix these herbs, and take ½ teaspoon of the mixture 3 times a day with 2\\ntablespoons of aloe vera gel. This combination \\nwill be quite eʃective in treating\\npitta-type anemia.\\nFOR KAPHA-TYPE ANEMIA\\n.

Or you can mix it with a little honey and then wash it down with water.\\nFOR ALL TYPES OF ANEMIA\\nEAT IRON-RICH FOODS\\n. Iron is a good blood builder, so foods rich in iron, such as beets,\\ncarrots, grapes, raisins, and currants, are used in the Ayurvedic treatment of most\\nanemias. Figs, dates, and date sugar are also good sources of iron. Pomegranate juice\\nand cranberry juice can be used as blood builders, as can a combination of beet and\\ncarrot juice. (Add a pinch of cumin to your carrot/beet juice for maximum eʃect.)\\nChlorophyll is also a good source of iron, and many times Ayurveda does suggest using\\nchlorophyll, generally in the form of spinach, chard, and other fresh green vegetables.\\nYOGURT AND TURMERIC\\n. Eat a cup of plain yogurt with up to 1 teaspoon turmeric on an\\nempty stomach, morning and afternoon. Do not eat this after sunset. If kapha is\\nunbalanced, eat this at noon only.\\nBLUE-GREEN ALGAE\\n. Blue-green algae can also be eʃectively used, but primarily for pitta\\nanemia. Because it is a rich source of \\nprana\\n, it is not good for vata individuals, as it will\\nmake them quite hyper. Kapha types may also find it beneficial.\\nCOPPER WATER\\n. Vata and kapha individuals may ɹnd copper water eʃective. Fill a\\ngenuine copper glass or cup with water and let it stand overnight, then drink it in the\\nmorning (see \\nappendix 1\\n).\\nDIET AND LIFESTYLE CHOICES\\n. These choices should follow the general guidelines (diet,\\nexercise, and so on) for each doshic \\nconstitutional type. For vata problems, follow the\\nanti-vata guidelines; for pitta anemia follow the pitta-soothing diet and other guidelines;\\nand for kapha-type anemia, follow the kapha-reducing guidelines.\\nCorrelation of Ayurvedic and Western Types of Anemia\\nClinical observation has shown that the various types of anemia classiɹed by\\nmodern medicine can be correlated with the types of anemia delineated by\\nAyurveda. For example, pitta-type anemia has been associated with mononucleosis\\nand hepatitis and may lead to problems with the liver. Cobalamine (vitamin B-12)-\\ndeɹciency anemia is also associated with pitta. Kapha-type anemia may lead to\\nhypo-proteinemic anemia and swelling, while vata-type anemia may be associated\\nwith iron deɹciency and folic acid–deɹciency anemia. By treating the vata–pitta–\\nkapha types of anemia, Ayurveda can at the same time treat the types of anemia\\ncategorized by modern medicine.\\nYOGA \\nASANAS\\n.\\n Yoga postures good for anemia of both the vata and kapha varieties', metadata={'source': 'Ayurveda.pdf', 'page': 126}),\n",

For all anemic conditions, \\nsurya pranayama\\n (Right Nostril breathing)\\nis recommended. Block your left nostril with your right ring ɹnger and breathe only\\nthrough the right nostril. Right Nostril breathing stimulates the liver, which plays an\\nimportant role in building the blood.\\n \\nAnger and Hostility\\n \\nAnger and hostility are signs of aggravated pitta in the nervous system. Pitta is\\nnecessary for right understanding and judgment, but when it gets disturbed or out of\\nbalance, it creates misunderstanding and wrong judgment, leading to anger and\\nhostility. The aim is to bring the pitta back to its normal constitutional function.\\nHere are several simple home remedies to cool down that hot pitta and keep tempers\\nunder control.\\nDIET\\n. Perhaps most important, a person who becomes angry easily or often should\\nfollow the pitta-pacifying diet (see \\nchapter 8\\n), especially avoiding hot, spicy and\\nfermented foods, citrus fruit, and sour fruit. Favor simple, bland foods and cool drinks,\\nand avoid alcohol and drinks with caffeine.\\nKEEP COOL\\n. It’s also not recommended for people with a pitta body type to take saunas\\nor steam baths, to get overheated from exercise or sports, or to be in too much direct\\nsun. In other words: keep cool.\\nOIL MASSAGE\\n. Rub some \\nbhringaraj\\n oil or coconut oil on your scalp and on the soles of the\\nfeet. That will help to bring down the excess pitta. (See instructions for preparing\\nherbalized ghees and oils in \\nappendix 2\\n.) You can do this every night before getting in\\nbed to regularly moderate pitta. Be sure to wear some old socks and a hat, or put a\\ntowel on your pillow, to prevent the oil from staining.\\nUSE SANDALWOOD OIL\\n. Another simple and eʃective way to help balance your emotions is\\nto place a drop of sandalwood essential oil on the “third eye” area between your\\neyebrows, as well as on the throat, breastbone, navel, temples, and wrists. Just a small\\namount of oil is sufficient.\\nHERBAL TEAS\\n.

Do not perform\\nthe Sun Salutation; do the Moon Salutation instead.\\nMEDITATE\\n. There is an ancient method of meditation that involves watching your every\\nemotion come and go, without either naming it or trying to tame it. As the feelings\\narise, breathe deeply, and exhale the emotions out.\\n \\nAngina\\n \\nAngina, or to give it its full name, angina pectoris (chest pain), is a condition created\\nby kapha dosha. Accumulated kapha blocks the ɻow of \\nprana\\n vata into the coronary\\nartery, so that the heart muscles do not receive suɽcient blood and oxygen supply. It is\\na kind of local anemia, resulting in pain that can be severe and frightening. Typically,\\nthe pain starts from the breastbone in the center of the chest, goes to the left shoulder,\\nand passes along the inner side of the upper arm to the tip of the little finger.\\nHERBAL REMEDIES\\n.

Skip breakfast, and don’t nibble anything. By\\nnoon your appetite will probably return, and you will be hungry and ready to eat.\\nLack of appetite is often due to continual munching, combined with drinking cold\\ndrinks, which depress agni. For the sake of good digestion and long-term health, as well\\nas reviving your appetite, both of these bad habits have to be stopped.\\nIf you are not hungry even by lunchtime, take some fresh ginger, chop a little into\\nsmall pieces, add some lime juice and a pinch of rock salt, and chew it up. That will\\nkindle agni and stimulate the appetite.\\nLow appetite may also be due to emotional factors. If that is the case, make a tea of\\nginger, \\nbrahmi\\n, and chamomile in equal proportions. Use 1 teaspoon of this mixture per\\ncup of water, steep for 5 to 10 minutes, and drink.\\nAlso, take ½ teaspoon of \\ntriphala\\n in a cup of warm water every night before going to\\nbed. Pour boiling water into the \\ntriphala\\n, and let it cool until it’s comfortable to drink.\\nThese few simple measures should be enough to help you regain a healthy appetite.\\nIf you try them and still don’t feel like eating, see your doctor, as lack of appetite can be\\na symptom of a more serious illness.\\n \\nArthritis\\n \\nAyurveda distinguishes three categories of arthritis, corresponding to vata, pitta, and\\nkapha.

They become dry and are not\\nswollen as they may be if excess vata is not the cause. The joints may also feel cold to\\nthe touch. They are painful mostly upon movement, and there is usually one particular\\ntender spot. Jogging, jumping, trampolining, or any strenuous exercise tends to\\naggravate the pain.\\n• \\nPitta-type arthritis\\n is characterized by inɻammation; the joint becomes swollen and \\nis\\npainful even without movement. It often looks red and feels hot to the touch.\\n• \\nIn kapha-type arthritis\\n, the joint also becomes stiʃ and swollen, but it feels cold and\\nclammy rather than hot. A little movement, rather than aggravating the pain, tends to\\nrelieve it. The pain is greater in the morning, and as the person starts moving around,\\nthe pain diminishes.\\nFOR ALL TYPES OF ARTHRITIS\\nTreatment for each type of arthritis is unique, as we shall see in a moment. But for\\nall cases, it is important to know that arthritis begins in the colon.\\nDepending on the person’s lifestyle, diet, and emotional pattern, either vata, pitta,\\nor kapha goes out of balance. Then that particular dosha slows down agni (digestive\\nfire), resulting in the toxic, sticky by-product of inadequate digestion known as ama.\\nVata, the main active dosha, brings the ama into the colon, and from there it travels\\nthrough the system and lodges in the \\nasthi dhatu\\n (bone tissue) and in the joints, giving\\nrise to the stiffness and pain characteristic of arthritis.\\nSo our aim in treating arthritis is to remove the ama from the joint and bring it back\\nto the colon, and then to eliminate it.\\nThis is why, to relieve arthritis, it is important to keep the colon clean. To accomplish\\nthis, if you do not know positively whether it is vata, pitta, or kapha arthritis, taking\\ntriphala\\n at night (1 teaspoon) with some warm water (½ to 1 cup) will be effective for all\\ntypes.

It can also be due to chronic indigestion or malabsorption. When digestion is\\nweak or sluggish, the food you eat undergoes fermentation and putrefaction in the\\ngastrointestinal tract, leading to the formation of ama, which has a foul smell.\\nStand in front of a mirror, and stick out your tongue. If the back portion of the\\ntongue is coated, that is the sign of ama, which is responsible for the bad breath.\\nThe primary Ayurvedic aim in treating bad breath is to kindle gastric ɹre (agni),\\nwhich in turn burns ama and alleviates the root cause of the condition. Here are several\\neffective home remedies to prevent and treat bad breath.\\nDIETARY AND HERBAL REMEDIES\\n• First monitor your diet. It’s important not to eat heavy meals, and to stay away\\nfrom cold drinks, ice cream, cheese, and yogurt, all of which reduce the gastric ɹre \\nand\\nslow down digestion, with a likely increase of ama.\\n• Then, after each meal (generally after lunch and dinner), chew about 1 teaspoon of\\nroasted fennel and cumin seeds (mixed half and half). This will improve digestion, which\\nindirectly helps to detoxify the colon. The licorice-ɻavored fennel seeds alone would be\\ndelicious and helpful, but this mixture will have a better effect.\\n• Drink ½ cup of aloe vera juice twice a day until freshness is restored to the breath.\\n• Slowly chewing one or two cardamom seeds also helps to minimize bad breath.\\nCardamom aids digestion and helps to reduce ama.\\n• After each meal, drink a cup of cumin-coriander-fennel tea (equal proportions) as a\\ndigestive aid. Steep about ¼ to ½ teaspoon of each herb per cup of hot water.\\nOTHER REMEDIES\\nTAKE CARE OF YOUR TEETH AND GUMS\\n. Another cause of bad breath is poor oral hygiene. It’s\\nimportant to clean the teeth after each meal. Use an Ayurvedic toothpaste containing\\nneem\\n or an herbal formula. Also use dental ɻoss every day. Applying some tea tree oil\\nmixed half and half with \\nneem\\n oil to the gums and gently massaging will help prevent\\nreceding gums. Be sure to spit out the residue rather than swallowing.

It may be related to disease—I have seen hair\\nloss in persons with diabetes, for example, or following typhoid infection. It may be due\\nto some fungal infection on the scalp, or to hormonal imbalance. A deɹciency of\\ncalcium, magnesium, and zinc may aʃect the nourishment of the hair enough that the\\nhair starts to fall out. And there is a deɹnite hereditary factor, in which genes appear to\\ntrigger hair loss at a certain age.\\nAccording to Ayurveda, early hair loss is often related to body type and the balance\\nof the doshas. Pitta individuals, and those who have excess pitta in their system, are\\nmore likely than the other body types to lose their hair early in life, or to ɹnd that their\\nhair becomes prematurely thin or gray. Excess pitta in the sebaceous gland, at the root\\nof the hair, or folliculitis (inɻammation of the hair follicles) can make the person start\\nlosing hair.\\nALOE VERA\\n. To reduce pitta and preserve the health of your hair, drink aloe vera juice\\n(⅓ cup) or take some aloe vera gel (1 tablespoon with a pinch of cumin) 3 times a day\\nfor about 3 months.\\nOIL MASSAGE\\n. Another eʃective way to pacify pitta is to rub some coconut oil on \\nyour\\nscalp and on the soles of your feet at bedtime. Wear some old socks, and to preserve the\\nhealth of your pillow, wear a loose woolen cap or cover the pillow with a towel so it\\nwon’t get damaged by the oil.\\n• Massaging the scalp with \\nbrahmi\\n oil or \\nbhringaraj\\n oil at bedtime can help to prevent\\nhair loss. In addition to the qualities of the oil, the massage itself will improve\\ncirculation at the root of the hair, thus bringing more nutrients to support hair growth.\\n• Massaging the hair with vitamin E oil may also be eʃective in preventing or\\nslowing hair loss.\\nFOOD FOR YOUR HAIR\\n.

There may be pain in the bladder area while\\nurinating, a condition called strangury. Let’s look at each of these.\\nRETENTION OF URINE IN THE BLADDER\\nIn this condition the bladder is distended but the person doesn’t pass urine. It may be\\ndue to constriction of the urethra, enlargement of the prostate gland, or perhaps a stone\\nin the urethra. The causes may be many, but the cure is simple:\\n• Take two towels or sponges, one dipped in hot water, the other dipped in cool\\nwater. About every minute, alternate placing them in the bladder area. This alternation\\nof hot and cold stimulates the bladder, and the person easily passes urine.\\n• If alternating hot and cold compresses isn’t completely successful, apply \\npunarnava\\npaste (\\npunarnava\\n powder with suɽcient water to make a paste) to the skin directly\\nabove the distended bladder. Leave it on for about half an hour.\\n• If the retention is due to stricture (narrowing) in the urethra or enlargement of the\\nprostate gland, then use this formula:\\npunarnava guggulu 4 parts\\nshilajit 1 part\\nTaking ½ teaspoon of this mixture 3 times a day with warm water will help\\nto dilate the stricture or relax the prostate gland and help to restore the easy\\nflow of the urine.\\nCYSTITIS\\nCystitis causes a burning sensation while urinating. To relieve this condition, drink\\ncoriander tea, cumin tea, or fennel tea. Or make a tea of equal proportions of these\\nthree herbs. Cumin-coriander-fennel tea is widely used in Ayurveda to relieve irritation\\nof the bladder while passing urine.\\nYou may also find this mixture effective for cystitis:\\npunarnava 5 parts\\ngokshura 4 parts', metadata={'source': 'Ayurveda.pdf', 'page': 144}),\n",

In such cases—the\\nvast majority—there is nothing much to do unless the cut is severe and bleeding is\\nexcessive.\\nSome people, however, bleed for a longer time, because the blood does not cooperate\\nand clot quickly enough. When a person continues to bleed, it basically means that the\\nblood is too thin. Although the problem usually has a relatively simple and benign cause,\\nfailure of the blood to clot—or gums, cuts, or wounds that start to bleed—may also be an\\nearly sign of blood cancer, leukemia, or hemophilia purpura, a pitta disorder that causes\\nprofuse bleeding under the skin.\\nFrom the Ayurvedic perspective, blood that fails to clot in a timely manner is due to\\na pitta imbalance. Excess pitta in the blood makes the blood hot, sharp, and penetrating\\nand doesn’t allow natural coagulation and clotting to occur.

It is caused by insuɽcient ɹber in the diet, insuɽcient water intake, lack of\\nexercise, heavy meat eating, and numerous other factors. Constipation may create\\ndistension and discomfort, ɻatulence and pain, headache and bad breath, and may lead\\nto absorption of toxins from the colon. Thus it is best to prevent constipation by keeping\\nvata in balance.\\nFOLLOW THE VATA-PACIFYING DIET\\n. One of the best ways to prevent constipation, especially if\\nyou have a predominantly vata constitution, is to follow the vata-balancing diet (see\\nchapter 8\\n). Stay away from cold foods and drinks, dried fruit, salads, and most beans;\\nfavor warm foods, warm drinks, and well-cooked vegetables. Some oil in the diet is\\nhelpful.\\nTRIPHALA\\n. Probably the best Ayurvedic remedy for constipation is \\ntriphala\\n, a\\ncombination \\nof three herbs beneɹcial for all doshic types (see \\nappendix 2\\n). Most\\nproblems with constipation can be corrected by taking ½ to 1 teaspoon of \\ntriphala\\n at\\nnight. Steep the herbs in a cup of hot water for 5 to 10 minutes, and drink.\\nSome people ɹnd that taking \\ntriphala\\n at night creates a diuretic action and they have\\nto get up several times to urinate. If that happens to you, you can steep the \\ntriphala\\n in a\\ncup of warm water overnight and drink it ɹrst thing in the morning. Actually, the best\\ntime to take \\ntriphala\\n is in the very early morning, around 4 or 5 \\nA.M\\n., but do your best\\nwithin your daily schedule.\\nHere are some further recommendations to help relieve constipation:\\nSNACK ON FRUIT\\n. Many varieties of fruit can help remedy constipation. So in between\\nmeals, eat some fruit. A banana, for example, is a mild laxative. Two ripe yellow\\nbananas, taken between meals, will help relieve constipation. (But don’t eat the\\nbananas with meals. They don’t combine well with other foods. See \\nchapter 8\\n for tips on\\nhealthy food combining.)\\nNOTE\\n: Bananas should be eaten when ripe. You can tell a ripe banana by its\\nbright yellow skin. The inside will be studded with tiny black dots. Green\\nbananas are constipating and should be avoided. Also avoid eating bananas\\nonce the skin turns black. They are overripe.\\nAN APPLE A DAY KEEPS THE DOCTOR AWAY\\n. There is a lot of truth in this old folk saying.

Don’t forget that fresh fruit and vegetables as well as whole\\ngrains are high in fiber, too.\\nMILK AND GHEE—MILD AND EFFECTIVE\\n. Taking 1 or 2 teaspoonfuls of ghee in a cup of hot milk at\\nbedtime is an eʃective but gentle means of relieving constipation. This is especially\\ngood for vata and pitta constitutions, but it may be too kapha-increasing for kapha\\ntypes to use regularly.\\nCASTOR OIL\\n. Castor oil can also be used, but only when the constipation is more\\nobstinate. At bedtime, make yourself a cup of ginger tea (either by boiling some fresh,\\nsliced ginger in water, or adding some powdered ginger to a cup of hot water), and then\\nadd 2 teaspoons of castor oil to the tea and drink it.\\nIf 2 teaspoons don’t bring the desired result, try the procedure again the next night,\\nincreasing the dose to 3 teaspoons, and then go to 4 teaspoons if necessary. Adjust your\\ndose according to what works.\\nSUGGESTION\\n: Use this castor oil laxative treatment on weekends, when you can\\nstay home!\\nCastor oil tends to create dependency, in the sense that once you use it, other\\npurgatives rarely work. That is why it is recommended to use castor oil for constipation\\nonly in severe cases or in emergencies, as a last resort, but not on a regular basis.\\nHowever, there is one way to avoid this dependency. Take 2 teaspoons of castor oil\\nwith 1 cup warm milk. This will give a good bowel movement without creating\\ndependency.\\nFLAXSEED\\n.

As a general rule, Ayurveda suggests\\nthat when babies six months old or younger get diarrhea, the mother should follow a\\npitta-pacifying diet.\\nAN APPLE A DAY\\n … A baby’s diarrhea can usually be corrected simply by feeding the child\\nsome cooked apple. Remove the skin and seeds, cook the apple, and add ½ teaspoon\\nghee, a pinch of cardamom, and a small pinch of ginger.

Many people use moisturizing creams to counteract\\ndry skin. But dryness of the skin usually comes from within rather than from external\\ncauses. For this reason, mere application of a moisturizer doesn’t truly solve the\\nproblem.\\nIn general, moisturizing creams work only temporarily. They stimulate secretions of\\nthe sebaceous glands, and for a while the skin \\nlooks soft and oily. But then the glands\\nbecome tired and exhausted, resulting in more dryness. You will have much greater\\nsuccess if you treat the dryness both externally, with natural oils, and internally, by\\nlubrication of the colon with oil enemas.\\nHere are several eʃective Ayurvedic home remedies to keep your skin smooth and\\nlustrous.\\nAPPLY SOME OIL\\n. In some cases, applying some oil to your skin may be all you need to\\neliminate dry skin. If your constitution is predominantly vata, apply sesame oil; if you\\nare pitta, apply sunflower or coconut oil. If you are kapha, apply corn oil.\\nHowever, application of oil to the skin will probably not be suɽcient. To treat the\\ninternal cause of the dryness, you’ll have to lubricate the colon with a gentle oil enema.\\nOIL ENEMA\\n. Here is the procedure:\\n• \\nStep 1:\\n Begin with a cleansing enema.

The\\neardrum may even become tight and painful.\\nHowever, before treating earache, it is important to first rule out several possibilities,\\nsuch as infection \\n(otitis externa\\n or \\notitis interna)\\n, perforated eardrum, or excess wax\\ncausing pressure on the ear (see “\\nEarwax\\n”). Having ruled these out, one can then treat\\nthe vata problem.\\nTEA TREE OIL\\n. Begin by pulling down on the lobe of your painful ear. If this hurts, it\\nmeans there is \\notitis externa\\n, external ear infection. To heal the infection, take a cotton\\nswab and dip it into tea tree oil, a wonderful natural disinfectant widely available at\\nnatural food stores and some pharmacies. Then apply the oil to the ear with the swab.\\nNOTE\\n: Using plain tea tree oil may create a burning sensation on sensitive\\nskin, so it is usually best to dilute it, using 10 to 20 drops of tea tree oil mixed in\\n1 ounce of sesame oil.\\nTEA TREE OIL WITH \\nNEEM\\n.\\n For an even more eʃective treatment, combine the tea\\ntree oil with \\nneem\\n oil.

In that\\ncase, for a day or two before doing the irrigation, soften the wax in the ear canal by\\nlubricating it with warm garlic oil. Take about 1 tablespoon of sesame oil, add ½ clove\\nof freshly chopped garlic, and boil it until the garlic pieces turn brown. It will have a\\npleasant smell. Then press the oil from the garlic, and strain it into a jar or other\\ncontainer. (Plain sesame oil will also work, but the garlic oil will be more effective.)\\nThen, 2 or 3 times a day, put a few drops of that oil—when it is warm, not hot—into\\nthe ear. That will lubricate the ear passage and soften the wax for easy removal.\\nDISSOLVE IT WITH HYDROGEN PEROXIDE\\n. You can also use a mild hydrogen peroxide solution\\n(about a 3 percent solution) to dissolve the wax. You can buy this solution in most\\npharmacies. Put a few drops in the ear. It will oxygenate the ear, and the wax will\\nsimply dissolve. When you’re finished, clean the ear with some warm sesame oil.\\nMASSAGE TO LOOSEN STUBBORN WAX\\n. For stubborn earwax, massage the outside of the ear. Put a\\nlittle sesame oil or castor oil on the mastoid bone (the bone behind the ear), and gently\\nmassage. Pull the ear lobe, and at the same time open your mouth. This will help to\\nloosen the ear wax, and it will come out quite easily when you irrigate with water.\\nHERBAL REMEDY\\n. The root cause of excessive earwax production is increased vata in the\\nmamsa dhatu\\n (muscle tissue). To deal with this, take \\ntriphala guggulu\\n tablets, 200 mg.\\ntwice a day, for one month. That will deɹnitely break down the body’s habit of forming\\nexcess earwax.\\nPREVENTION\\n. Here is another excellent way to prevent the buildup of earwax. Once a\\nmonth, sleep on your left side. Fill your right ear with warm sesame oil, and go to bed.\\n(Put an old towel on the pillow to catch the excess oil.) The whole night, the ear passage\\nwill be soaked in the sesame oil. The wax will rise up toward the surface of the ear\\ncanal, and you can clean it out in the morning with a dry cotton swab. (Don’t stay\\nawake all night trying not to turn over; just sleep comfortably. Even a couple of hours\\nwith the oil filling the canal will do the trick.)\\nThe next night, sleep on the other side and treat the other ear in the same way.

Here, one has the feeling of swinging or\\ndisequilibrium, of being subjectively in motion. This type of dizziness is caused primarily\\nby excess pitta. The diʃerence between the two is subtle and not easy to pinpoint,\\nespecially since vata and pitta are both always involved. But it is helpful to distinguish\\nbetween the two, as some aspects of treatment will be different.\\nT\\nIME TO\\n S\\nEE THE\\n D\\nOCTOR\\nThe remedies in this section are simple, eʃective means of relieving dizziness.\\nBut if dizziness or fainting persists after using them, it would be wise to see a\\nneurologist or another medical expert, because the dizziness might be due to\\nsome serious pathology.\\nVertigo, a spinning, merry-go-round kind of feeling, may be related to infection in\\nthe inner ear, head injury, or viral infection. It may be due to Ménière’s disease, a\\ncondition in which increased pressure in the middle ear generates a feeling of vertigo.\\nMénière’s disease will result in progressive hearing loss if it’s not treated. All these\\nconditions have to be suspected and ruled out before undertaking home treatment for\\ndizziness.

When the eyeball becomes steady by\\nfocusing on a stable point, it sends a message to the brain that calms down the \\nrajasic\\nquality of vata dosha. This works well for objective dizziness.\\nThe kind of dizziness known as \\nmotion sickness\\n is often associated with nausea and\\nvomiting. To help with motion sickness, before starting the trip, take one 00-size capsule\\nɹlled with ginger powder. Bring some more along on the trip.

The person may suddenly get\\nhot flashes, and may have bloodshot eyes.\\n• Vata individuals, especially when vata is in excess, are prone to get allergies to raw\\nfoods; beans (black beans, adzuki beans, pinto beans, and so on) and certain animal\\nproteins. Vata food allergies are likely to manifest as bloating of the stomach, burping,\\ngas, gurgling of the stomach, and vague abdominal discomfort and pain.

       " Document(page_content=' \\nGallstones\\n \\nGallstones are a kapha disorder associated with underactive thyroid and slow\\nmetabolism. Gallstones begin with stagnation of bile in the gallbladder. The bile\\nbecomes thick, accumulates, coagulates, and slowly leads to stone formation.\\nPrevention of gallstones, and what to do when gallstones are present, are two\\ndiʃerent lines of treatment. First let’s consider what to do when gallstones have already\\ndeveloped.\\nTO ALLEVIATE THE PAIN\\n. In general, gallstones are not painful. They may remain in the\\ngallbladder for a long time without causing any pain; indeed, you will not know they\\nare there. Pain occurs when the gallbladder tries to push the stones out of the\\ngallbladder through the bile duct.\\nTo reduce pain, put a warm castor oil pack on your abdomen. Castor oil produces a\\nslow, sustained heat that is soothing and healing. Warm up about 3 tablespoons of\\ncastor oil and pour it onto a handkerchief or \\nother soft cloth, spreading it equally on the\\ncloth. Place this compress on the abdomen above the gallbladder (on the right side of\\nyour abdomen, above the line of your navel and below the ribs). If you have a hot water\\nbottle, you may place it on top of the pack to keep it warm. (Electric heating pads are\\nnot recommended.)\\nFOR ACUTE ATTACK\\n. During an acute gallstone attack, use this herbal formula:\\nmusta 4 parts\\ntrikatu 3 parts\\nguduchi 6 parts\\nTake ¼ teaspoon of this mixture 2 or 3 times a day with honey. It will reduce\\nthe pain and ease the gallbladder attack.\\nLIVER FLUSH TO ELIMINATE THE GALLSTONE\\n. When the pain is gone, you can do a liver ɻush to\\nwash out the gallstone. This liver ɻush should not be done if the stone is large, \\nso before\\ndoing the treatment it is vital to get an ultrasound report on the exact size of the gallstone and\\nconsult with your physician about using the treatment\\n. If it is a small and recently formed\\nstone, this treatment will help. If it is quite large, such as 3 to 4 mm. in diameter, then\\nthe flushing treatment will not be good.\\nT\\nIME TO\\n S\\nEE THE\\n D\\nOCTOR\\nIMPORTANT\\n: This liver-ɻushing treatment should \\nnot\\n be done without the\\napproval and guidance of your physician or the direct supervision of an\\nAyurvedic physician. Otherwise, you may damage the gallbladder and\\nexperience dangerous complications.\\nCombine 8 ounces olive oil, 4 ounces lemon juice, a chopped fresh garlic clove, and', metadata={'source': 'Ayurveda.pdf', 'page': 198}),\n",

The next day you will pass\\nsome green stuʃ in the stools. This is thick, coagulated bile containing the gallstone\\ncrystals.\\nPREVENTION OF GALLSTONES\\n. In order to prevent gallstone formation, one has to improve both\\nthyroid function and metabolism. In general, the following formula is effective:\\npunarnava 5 parts\\nshatavari 4 parts\\nkutki 2 parts\\nchitrak 2 parts\\nmusta 3 parts\\nshilajit ¼ part\\nThis mixture (¼ teaspoon 3 times a day with honey), taken regularly for 2 to\\n3 months, will help to prevent gallstone formation.\\nYOGA POSTURES\\n. Several yoga \\nasanas\\n are beneɹcial for prevention of gallstones. The Bow\\npose, Peacock pose, Spinal Twist, and Narayan pose (lying on the left side) will help to\\nempty the gallbladder. (For illustrations \\nof yoga postures, see \\nappendix 4\\n.) These\\npostures will improve circulation in the gallbladder, helping to prevent the\\ncrystallization process.\\nDIET\\n. Stay away from deep-fried food, dairy products such as yogurt and cheese, and\\nall fatty foods, especially animal fat and any saturated fat. These accelerate coagulation\\nof bile into gallstones.\\n \\nGas and Flatulence\\n \\nNo one under the sun is exempt from ɻatulence. Every person at some time or\\nanother gets gases and disturbances in the colon.\\nWe are all vulnerable to this condition for several reasons. First, the colon is the\\nmain seat of vata dosha, the dosha that is derived from ether and air. If vata increases in\\nthe colon, due to eating vata-aggravating foods, cold weather, anxiety, insomnia, and\\nother factors, gases may build up.

Grate some fresh ginger root until you have about 1 teaspoon of pulp,\\nand add 1 teaspoon of lime juice. Take this mixture immediately after eating.\\nLEMON JUICE REMEDY\\n. Another simple method to reduce excess gas is to stir 1 teaspoon\\nlemon juice and ½ teaspoon baking soda into 1 cup cool water. Drink it down quickly,\\nright after meals, for best results!

That headache will be more in\\nthe temple or temporal area.\\nBecause of a kapha-producing diet, systemic kapha in the stomach increases, enters\\ninto the general circulation, and can lodge in the sinuses and create kapha-type sinus\\nheadaches. Kapha headaches tend to be more in the frontal and nasal areas of the head.\\nHeadaches can also be due to ear problems, eye problems, insomnia, food allergies,\\nexposure to cold temperatures, tension in the neck, or working too long (for instance, in\\nfront of a computer) in a wrong position. Even using two pillows below the head for\\nsleeping can cause headaches.\\nClearly the causes are extremely varied.

For sinus headaches (usually related to kapha), make a paste\\nout of ½ teaspoon cinnamon and sufficient water, and apply it locally.\\nSALTWATER REMEDY\\n. For some individuals, a kapha-type headache can be quickly relieved\\nby this simple remedy: Mix 1 teaspoon warm water and at least ⅛ teaspoon salt to\\nmake a thick, concentrated solution.

However, if\\nyou have a headache that persists for more than a couple of days; if your\\nheadache is accompanied by a fever or stiʃ neck; if you also experience\\nneurological symptoms such as blurred vision, diɽculty with coordination or\\nspeech, memory loss, numbness, or weakness in your arms or legs; if you wake\\nup at midnight with a headache; or if you are having headaches often that seem\\nto be becoming more severe, then please see a doctor.\\nYOGA POSTURES FOR HEADACHES\\nGenerally, a person having headaches should do the Moon Salutation. Certain yoga\\npostures are also helpful, such as the Boat pose, Hidden Lotus, Bow pose, Spinal Twist,\\nPalm Tree pose, and Standing on the Toes. (For illustrations of yoga poses see \\nappendix\\n4\\n.) Inverted poses such as Headstand, Shoulder Stand, and the Plow pose are not\\nrecommended.\\n \\nHearing Loss\\n \\nHearing is governed by an aspect of vata known as \\nprana\\n vata. In older people,\\nprana\\n vata tends to get debilitated, leading to what is known as conductive or nerve\\ndeafness: The person doesn’t hear properly because the nerves become weak.\\nTo improve hearing, try the following natural remedies:\\nTAKE YOGARAJ \\nGUGGULU\\n.

Kapha is related to\\nincreased blood viscosity.\\nPhysical and emotional stress, including anger and anxiety, constrict the blood\\nvessels and can increase blood pressure for a time.

If you are late to eat at\\nyour regular mealtime and you feel light-headed or dizzy while standing up, or\\nexperience palpitations, tremor, nausea, drowsiness, sweating, nervousness, or mental\\nconfusion, all these indicate hypoglycemia. In some serious cases of hypoglycemia, a\\nperson can even have convulsions and fall into coma.\\nThe brain uses blood sugar (glucose) as its sole food, and it depends on it for the\\nnecessary energy for its activity. If the brain doesn’t receive suɽcient blood sugar, it\\ngoes into crisis; it will create tremors, headache, sweating, nausea, drowsiness, and the\\nother symptoms mentioned because it is starving for blood sugar.\\nAccording to Ayurveda, hypoglycemia is common in persons with pitta \\nprakruti\\n (a\\npitta constitution) or pitta \\nvikruti\\n (a present pitta imbalance). Increased pitta stimulates\\nthe secretion of insulin, which lowers the blood sugar level and creates hypoglycemia.\\nHypoglycemia in turn induces the secretion of adrenaline, which causes rapid heartbeat\\nand tremors.\\nAn unduly large dose of insulin taken by a diabetic person may lead to\\nhypoglycemia. This condition is also common among alcoholics.\\nHypoglycemia is a disorder that needs careful attention. To maintain their blood\\nsugar level, pitta individuals should eat regular meals—breakfast, lunch, and dinner—\\nand also have some fruit or another snack between meals or whenever they feel\\nhypoglycemic \\nsymptoms. Emphasize proteins and complex carbohydrates for main\\nmeals; they digest more slowly, so the rises and falls in blood sugar will be less rapid.\\nT\\nIME TO\\n S\\nEE THE\\n D\\nOCTOR', metadata={'source': 'Ayurveda.pdf', 'page': 222}),\n",

Steep ½ teaspoon\\ncrushed or ground-up bay leaf in a cup of hot water for about 10 minutes to make a tea.\\nAdd a pinch of cardamom, and drink after eating.\\nFASTING\\nFasting can be beneɹcial to dispel indigestion. Fasting not only kindles the digestive\\nɹre, it also gives the digestive system a rest. When you have indigestion, you can either\\nobserve a complete fast, or try this: Drink 1 cup of sweet fresh pineapple juice with a\\npinch of ginger, a pinch of black pepper, and ½ teaspoon organic sugar.

For best digestion, take small sips of warm water during a meal.\\n• Fill your stomach to one-third of its capacity with food and one-third with liquid,\\nleaving one-third empty. This aids in proper digestion and promotes mental clarity.\\n• Chew your food well to make sure the saliva is well mixed in. Saliva plays a major\\nrole in digestion.\\n• You can ɹnish your meal by drinking a cup of lassi. This is made by blending 4\\nteaspoons of yogurt with 2 pinches each of ginger and cumin powder in 1 cup of water.\\n• Yoga postures that can be helpful for improving digestion include Leg Lifts and the\\nPeacock pose.

       " Document(page_content='Muscle cramps and spasms have numerous causes. They may be due to insuɽcient\\nblood supply to the muscle or, in some cases, to excess blood supply, as in the case of\\n“writer’s cramp.” Muscle spasms can be due to lack of calcium in the diet or\\nmalabsorption of calcium, since calcium plays a significant role in relaxing the muscle. A\\nrelated problem is hypoparathyroidism (underactive parathyroid), in which the person\\nloses calcium; this may also cause the muscles to undergo spasm. Exposure to cold and\\npoor circulation may also be responsible.\\nThe Ayurvedic understanding is, in simplest terms, that muscle spasms are caused by\\nvata dosha. Vata, increased by mobile, cold, or rough qualities, makes a muscle stiʃ and\\nhard, and it undergoes spasm.\\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELIEF\\n. Whenever a muscle is under spasm\\n• Grab hold of it.\\n• At the same time, press your index ɹnger deeply into the “belly” of the muscle (the\\nbulging central part of the muscle) for 15 to 20 seconds. A \\nmarma\\n point (like an\\nacupressure point) is located in the center of the muscle; pressing on it helps the muscle\\nrelax.\\n• Take a few deep breaths.\\nThis procedure will increase circulation, and the muscle will relax.\\nANOTHER PRESSURE POINT REMEDY\\n. A \\nmarma\\n point is located at the midpoint of both the lips. If\\nthere is a spasm in the upper body, such as in the arms or ɹngers, grab hold of your\\nupper lip, in the middle, between your thumb and index ɹnger. If the spasm is in the\\nlegs or the lower part of the body, grab the lower lip.\\nThese energy points on the lips send messages to the brain, which in turn relays a\\nsignal to the motor system to relax the muscles. Just grabbing the lips for 30 seconds\\nshould help relieve the spasm. Press fairly strongly, but not hard enough to be painful.\\nCONTRACT AND RELAX THE MUSCLE\\n. Repeatedly alternate contraction and relaxation of the\\nmuscle. This will improve circulation and help to release lactic acid, which will relax the\\nmuscle.\\nMASSAGE\\n. Another approach is to apply a little oil to the muscle belly and gently\\nmassage. \\nMahanarayan\\n oil is best if you have it; otherwise, some sesame oil or other oil\\nwill do. Gentle massage of the painful cramped muscle will relax the muscle ɹbers,\\nimprove the circulation, and pacify the vata. That will help relieve the spasm.\\nAfter rubbing in the \\nmahanarayan\\n oil, apply a little heat. For best results, use a hot\\nwater bottle (not an electric heating pad).\\nWinter, with its dry, cold weather, is vata season. During winter season, when vata\\nindividuals get exposed to the cold, their muscles may cramp.

As a result, they may\\ndevelop rhinitis, with nasal congestion and nasal discharge. Even in the absence of\\ninfection, dryness in the atmosphere may dry up the mucous membranes and nasal\\npassage; to compensate for that, the body will produce more mucus. Then, due to\\ncontinuing dry heat in the environment, the nasal discharge becomes thick, dry, and\\ncrusty. This is known as nasal crust.\\nPeople with deviated nasal septum can also accumulate nasal discharge, and because\\nof dryness in the air it may form a crust. Nasal crust can create stuʃy nose, sinus\\nheadache, and diɽculty breathing. It can be one of the causes of snoring and of sleep\\napnea. Nosebleeds may also be due to nasal crust.\\nAyurvedic medicine offers a number of effective remedies:\\nSTEAM IT\\n. The simplest remedy is to inhale steam.

Keep children busy with\\ncreative play; don’t let them watch violent or horrifying television programs or read\\nfrightening stories.\\nThe child’s room should be pleasant and ɹlled with sweetness, with nice music and\\nperhaps some tinkling bells.

Vata dreams are active and hyper. They are plentiful, and the\\ndreamer may well forget them in the morning. Horror, fear, running, jumping,\\nɻying high in the sky, falling deep down into a valley, being attacked or pursued,\\nbeing locked up—these are vata dreams.\\n• Pitta dreams. These dreams can be rather violent. In addition to such themes as\\nteaching, studying, trying to solve a problem, or failing at an examination, pitta\\ndreams may involve fire, war, nuclear weapons, fighting, killing, and murder.\\n• Kapha dreams. Kapha dreams are generally mild and romantic. Water ɹgures\\nprominently, such as swimming in the ocean. Seeing gardens, lotus ɻowers, swans,\\nand elephants and eating candy are all characteristic of kapha dreams. Drowning,\\nor seeing oneself as dead, are “negative” aspects of the kapha dream repertory.\\nEAT EARLY\\n. Eat dinner before seven o’clock.

Trauma to the nose, extreme dryness of the\\nnasal passage so that the nasal mucous membranes crack and bleed, allergies, rhinitis, a\\nnasal polyp, or high blood pressure may all cause nosebleed. Going to a high altitude or\\nconsuming excess alcohol are also possible causes.\\nUsually we don’t have any time to investigate the cause; we need to treat it\\nimmediately. Here are several effective remedies:\\nDRINK COOL WATER\\n. This alone will stop many nosebleeds.\\nUSE A COLD COMPRESS\\n. Dip a handkerchief or any clean soft cloth into cold water, and place\\nit on the forehead and the nose. Then \\ngently\\n blow the nose so that the clot, if there is\\none, comes out. (If there is a dry nasal crust, it will irritate the nasal passage and cause\\nbleeding.)\\nSNIFF COLD WATER\\n. Take a little cool water in your palm, inhale it up into the nose, and\\ngently blow the nose.\\nSQUEEZE YOUR NOSE\\n. If the cold water doesn’t stop the bleeding, then pinch the nose with\\nyour thumb and index ɹnger, as if you were about to dip under water. Hold for 2 or 3\\nminutes, breathing normally through the mouth. That should stop the bleeding.\\nGHEE OINTMENT\\n. If the bleeding still doesn’t stop, another simple remedy is to put a\\ncouple of drops of lukewarm ghee in each nostril. Dip a cotton swab into a jar of ghee,\\nand apply it to the nose. Ghee is hemostatic—that is, it stops bleeding.\\nSTAND OR SIT UPRIGHT\\n. Don’t lie down, which will encourage bleeding. Also don’t do any\\ninverted yoga postures such as Headstand, \\nShoulder Stand or Plow. Remaining upright\\nwill minimize bleeding.\\nHUMIDIFY YOUR SURROUNDINGS\\n. Many nosebleeds are due to a dry nose, caused by hot, dry\\nair. So as a preventive measure in dry climates or in winter when heating the house can\\ncreate a lot of dry air, be sure to humidify your bedroom, workroom, or the entire living\\nspace.

You may have a\\nserious health problem. The bleeding may be due to high blood pressure, which\\nneeds to be cared for. Or it could possibly be caused by leukemia, a type of blood\\ncancer.\\nFOLLOW THE PITTA-PACIFYING DIET\\n. According to Ayurvedic principles, even though nosebleed\\nhas some vata symptoms, such as dryness and cracking of the nasal passages, it is\\nessentially a pitta disorder, in which pitta becomes hot and sharp and causes the\\nbleeding. So when you have a nosebleed, don’t eat hot and spicy foods, abstain from\\nalcohol and cigarettes, and don’t work under the hot sun. These are all pitta-provoking.\\n \\nObesity\\n \\nObesity is a condition in which an individual is signiɹcantly overweight, and an\\nexcessive amount of body fat has accumulated under the chin and on the breasts, belly,\\nbuttocks, and/or thighs.

Ultimately, obesity reduces happiness.\\nTo a great extent, obesity is due to the socioeconomic problems of an aʀuent\\nsociety.

Immediately after exercise, kapha individuals will feel\\nhungry and thirsty and will want to rush to the restaurant to have a cold drink and a\\nbite to eat.

So be persistent, and over time you will be successful.\\n \\nOsteoporosis\\n \\nOsteoporosis is a thinning and increasing porosity of the bone due to increased vata.\\nBones are normally porous, but because of increasing vata—a normal occurrence as a\\nperson grows older—the porosity increases. Sometimes the individual loses so much\\nbone that weak spots develop in the skeletal structure. Then the hips, forearms, or even\\nthe spine can fracture quite easily. The bones may crack under the body’s own weight,\\nor a minor injury may be enough to create a fracture.\\nOsteoporosis is more common in women than men. Women lose bone rapidly after\\nmenopause. This is because the postmenopausal body produces little or no estrogen,\\nwhich is necessary for maintaining bone metabolism utilizing calcium, magnesium, zinc,\\nand other materials for building the bone. So it is during the postmenopausal years that\\nwomen may have a tendency toward osteoporosis.\\nMen also need estrogen to maintain strong bones, but testosterone and prostatic\\nsecretions also play an important role. However, men may lose bone mass due to heavy\\ndrinking, heavy smoking, chewing tobacco, and taking steroids.\\nLack of exercise can also reduce bone mass. To some extent, people need some stress\\nto the body, in the form of exercise. Research has shown that if a person is conɹned to\\nbed for several weeks, the bones become signiɹcantly weaker. Once the ill eʃects of lack\\nof exercise became clear, exercise programs were designed even for astronauts in space.\\nExercise is a food for the bones.\\nFor women, the combination of increased vata simply from growing older (see\\nchapter 2\\n, where we talk about the stages of life), plus the menopausal cessation of\\nestrogen, may have a powerfully deleterious effect on bone mass.\\nEXERCISE\\n. Gentle, daily exercise for 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week, can help to treat\\nosteoporosis. Walking is excellent and quite sufficient, but you may do swimming, gentle\\njogging, or whatever suits your constitution and level of ɹtness, and the condition of\\nyour bones.\\nSome people recommend weight-bearing exercise, even including weight lifting, for\\nbuilding bone. While this is good in general, for a person with osteoporosis it can be\\nquite dangerous; as mentioned above, even a slight injury may crack the fragile bones of\\na person with osteoporosis. Therefore a good, \\nsafe way to begin an exercise program is\\nto do some underwater exercise.

Do about 10 repetitions of the Ashwini Mudra. This way you train your\\norgan to be ready but not to ejaculate. To succeed at this, you have to practice with\\ngreat care.\\nDo this exercise about 1 to 2 hours before making love.\\nIMPORTANT\\n: This is not masturbation, nor an endorsement of masturbation.\\n• You can also learn to control ejaculation by contracting the muscles of the buttocks.\\n• Locate the \\nmarma\\n point (an energy center like an acupressure point) at the center\\nof the glans penis, on the underside.

It is\\nbeneɹcial to purify any stone before using it. Soaking it for two days in saltwater or\\nmilk should be sufficient. This will not harm the stone.\\n• When you wear a gemstone, it should touch the skin through a small window in the\\nsetting, so that the subtle energies of the stone can interact directly with the energies of\\nthe body.\\n• Where you wear the stone is important. Here are some recommendations:\\ndiamond—ring finger\\npearl—little finger\\nred coral—ring finger\\nemerald—little finger\\nopal—ring finger\\nyellow sapphire—index finger\\nblue sapphire—middle finger\\nAyurveda generally recommends that rings be worn on the right hand, though in the\\nWest, if someone wants to wear their wedding ring on the left hand to conform with\\ntradition, that is all right.\\n• Processed or chemically treated stones may not have the same healing energy. It is\\nbest to get authentic, unprocessed, clean stones without a ɻaw or crack. When you are\\nconsidering buying a stone, be sure to use a magnifying glass to examine it for cracks or\\nimperfections.\\n• Stones should be 3 to 5 karats if possible, but a 1-karat diamond is large enough. A\\nstone that is too small will not produce much of an effect.\\n• Unless you are knowledgeable both in stones and in Vedic astrology \\n(jyotish\\n), it is\\nwise to consult an expert before investing in a stone.

The most common vehicles used in Ayurveda are water, milk, honey, aloe\\nvera, and ghee. Raw sugar may also be used at times.

Medicated\\nenemas pacify vata and alleviate many vata disorders, such as constipation, abdominal\\ndistension, insomnia, backache, neck pain, arthritis, sciatica, anxiety, and various\\nnervous disorders. It is said that there are at least eighty vata-related disorders, and that\\nbasti\\n is a complete treatment for 80 percent of them. \\nBasti\\n also is eʃective for treating\\nchronic fever, sexual disorders, kidney stones, hyperacidity, and numerous other\\nconditions.\\nNOTE\\n: Medicated enemas are not to be used by anyone suʃering from diarrhea,\\nbleeding from the rectum, indigestion, cough, breathlessness, ascites, profuse\\nedema, or active hemorrhoids. Individuals with diabetes or anemia, the aged,\\nand children below the age of seven should also not receive medicated enemas.\\nOil enemas should not be used if there is acute fever, diarrhea, cold, paralysis,\\nheart pain, severe abdominal pain, or emaciation.\\nThe best times for \\nbasti\\n are in the morning or evening. The stomach should be empty,\\nso wait at least three hours after eating. Make sure the environment is clean, warm, and\\ncomfortable: An area where you can lie down near the toilet is best. You will need an\\nenema bag or syringe, a measuring cup, a hot plate or stove (this doesn’t have to be in\\nthe bathroom!), the oil and/or herbal substance, and towels.\\nThe usual procedure for \\nbasti\\n is ɹrst to introduce 5 ounces of warm (not hot) sesame\\noil into the rectum and retain it for 10 minutes. Then, without expelling the oil,\\nintroduce a mixture of oil and herbal tea and retain it for at least 30 minutes. The\\nmixture should consist of another 5 ounces of sesame oil, mixed with 16 ounces (1 pint)\\nof tea made from herbs steeped in hot water, then strained and cooled to about body\\ntemperature. In this book, the most frequently suggested herbal formula is \\ndashamoola\\n,\\nwhich is particularly effective for balancing vata.\\nTo introduce the ɻuid into the rectum, ɹrst ɹll the enema bag, which should be\\nsuspended about 3 feet above your position. Allow all air to be expelled from the tube,\\nand close the clip on the hose. Then lie on the ɻoor on your left side, your left (bottom)', metadata={'source': 'Ayurveda.pdf', 'page': 313}),\n",

Lubricate the tip of the\\nsyringe with oil or ghee. Make sure the anal area is clean and lubricated. Carefully and\\nslowly insert the tip of the syringe into the rectum, then release the clip and allow all\\nthe fluid to enter. When the enema bag is empty, remove the tip.\\nAgain, try to hold the oil for 10 minutes, and then hold the oil/herbal mixture for\\nanother 30 minutes if you can. While holding the ɻuid inside, assume a hands-and-knees\\nposition for a while and elevate the buttocks; this relaxes the colon. Periodically\\nmassage the colon area lightly with a counterclockwise motion (as seen when you look\\ndown toward your navel). Massage up the left side to the rib cage, across to the right\\nside, and down. (This is opposite to the way food journeys through and serves to propel\\nthe enema fluid up into the higher areas of the colon.)\\nWhen the ɻuid has been retained for the suggested time (or if you ɹnd you just can’t\\nhold it), sit on the toilet and allow the passage of the fluid and fecal matter.\\nYou may wish to wear a sanitary pad of some kind in your underwear for a few\\nhours following \\nbasti\\n, as there is likely to be some seepage of residual oil.\\nYou may note that for some conditions discussed in this book, only an oil enema, or\\nonly a \\ndashamoola\\n enema—and occasionally only a warm water enema—is\\nrecommended. Follow the recommendations for that condition.\\nFor some individuals, the ɻuid does not come back out. That simply means that the\\ncolon was very dry and that all the liquid has been absorbed. This is entirely natural and\\nis nothing to worry about.\\nNasya\\nNasya\\n is the nasal administration of herbal oils, ghee, or ɹne powders. If you were to\\nreceive \\nnasya\\n in a \\npanchakarma\\n treatment at an Ayurvedic clinic, you would lie face up\\non a table with your head tilted back, nostrils “facing the sky.” A small amount of an\\nappropriate powder might be placed into your nostrils, or 3 to 5 drops of a medicated\\noil or ghee.\\nWhen you do \\nnasya\\n yourself, simply dip your little ɹnger (clean and with the nail\\nclosely trimmed) into ghee or whatever \\nherbalized oil might be recommended, and\\nlightly massage the inside of your nostril with your little ɹnger.

       "\"I'd be happy to help!\\n\\nBased on the provided context, here's an answer to your question:\\n\\nDuring pregnancy, it is essential to maintain good digestion and overall health. Some key precautions include avoiding emotional eating, as this can affect digestion negatively. Eat only two or three meals a day, with small sips of warm water during meals, rather than snacking in between. Make sure to chew food well, as saliva plays a crucial role in digestion.\\n\\nAdditionally, consider drinking a cup of lassi after meals, made by blending yogurt, ginger, and cumin powder with water. This can help regulate blood pressure. Also, practice yoga postures that aid digestion, such as Leg Lifts and the Peacock pose.\\n\\nFurthermore, take care of your teeth and gums by maintaining good oral hygiene practices, and consider applying tea tree oil or clove oil to relieve toothaches. It's crucial to get any cavities treated and follow Ayurvedic recommendations for healthy teeth and gums.\\n\\nLastly, if you experience any digestive issues during pregnancy, try drinking a simple tea made with blue paper and sunlight, as described in the context. This can have a cooling and soothing effect.\\n\\nPlease note that these precautions are based on the provided context only and may not be applicable or suitable for everyone.
